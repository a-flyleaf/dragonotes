Hiya, I'm Archaeoraptor and I like dragons, HTML/CSS, and menial repetitive tasks. I don't really like dragon bio or forum post code-wrangling. So here we are!

I've been on Flight Rising since 2015, and while my activity over the years has been on and off, it's the one (1) petsite I keep coming back to. Most of my dragon-time is spent coli grinding, forum lurking, and occasiontally tackling the neverending WIP that is dragon bio updating.

Sometimes I do writing and art, and sporadically offer the latter to Sornieth's denizens. For more stuff I do, check out [my main site](https://a-flyleaf.github.io)~
