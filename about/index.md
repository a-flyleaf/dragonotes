> ["Archaeoraptor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoraptor) is the informal generic name for a fossil chimera from China in an article published in <i>National Geographic</i> magazine in 1999. The magazine claimed that the fossil was a "missing link" between birds and terrestrial theropod dinosaurs. [...] Further scientific study showed it to be a forgery constructed from rearranged pieces of real fossils from different species.

Hello! Around Flight Rising I call myself Archaeoraptor, and I'm a nerd on the internet who's obsessed with dragons. I also happen to like web coding (and don't care for BBCode's limits), so I made this site to stash extended info and other records.

I've been on Flight Rising since 2015, on and off; sometimes I'm on all day erry day, sometimes I practically forget FR exists. But unlike many other petsites I've tried, dragon hell keeps me coming back, and I don't plan on leaving for good any time soon. Long live the pixel lizards!

## gameplay notes
This info is usually on my clan profile in some form, but to expand on it:

- My primary means of making dragon cash is **exalting**, so when I'm active I can snatch up lots of fodder. Adults usually get exalted ASAP; hatchlings are often placeholders while I'm waiting for a nest to hatch. Fodder always goes through the coli wringer before exalting (so they'll be named), and I try to (but don't always) notice bio notes before sendoff.
- Always happy to see fodder dragons get actual homes, so I am **very open** to
	- returning the dragon(s) to the original breeder/seller,
	- attempting to rehome the dragon(s) at the request *of* the breeder/seller, and
	- giving the dragon(s) to anyone else who asks. (But I may or may not have an exalt restoration available, so you're eyeing an adult, act fast!)
- **sales**: If a dragon is a perma I am *extremely* unlikely to sell it. You're welcome to offer & I'll note your interest in the dragon's bio, but don't count on it. Temporary dragons (fodder, designated sales, and project beeders) are fair game!
	- Disclaimer: I can be very, *very* slow to finish breeding projects. If you've asked for a dragon and are inactive when I'm finished, the dragon will be held at my own discretion.
- **breeding**: Temporary dragons are A-OK. Permas I may be pickier on, and note that I may be reluctant to let them leave my lair; I'd prefer the breeding either occurs in my lair (happy to provide item collateral, if you're concerned about your own dragon) or that both dragons are sent to a trusted nest renter.
	- No payment necessary for either option.
- **friends**: Mostly people I know somehow, and occasionally others I've had nice exchanges with! Y'all're welcome to my cauldron, nests, food, and/or leveling services at any time. (Non-friends can also ask, honestly, though I may want some form of payment depending on the request.)
	- No random friend requests.
	- Sometimes I clear my friends list of people I don't know and/or barely interact with. Nothing personal!

## loresterf
My lore is perpetually being tweaked and poked and archived and otherwise toyed around with. Essentially, I have a lot of dragons, and they are scattered all over Sornieth because every time I try to establish One Consistent Clan, inevitably fractures and/or side groups spawn.

I'm havin' fun and that's all I really care about ᕕ(&nbsp;ᐛ&nbsp;)ᕗ

## bonus factoids because why not
- I discovered [one of the site founders](https://www1.flightrising.com/clan-profile/14) as a kid through [one of her how-to-draw books](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/3053598)! (Incidentally I can also thank a note in the back, about making up your own dragons and imagining stories for them, for nudging me to get into writing.)
	- Unfortunately I did not know about Flight Rising until long after the Kickstarter had ended. Not that I would've had the financial means to back it at the time, but still, big sad.
- When I joined, there were [15 dragons a page](https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/119548625225), non-negotiable, no den, no tabs. (And Baldwin did not exist. And you couldn't search the Auction House, not to the extent you can now. And multi-hued genes were barely a thing. And---well, just take a gander at [the chronological update reference](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/3053598), and know that it makes me feel very Dragon Old sometimes.)
- I chose Plague because I thought the deities were previews of the dragons you could get; Shadow was a close second. (I knew very little about FR before joining.) Love me some edgy horror-y aesthetics.
	- If I *had* to change flights, I'd consider Shadow (still a favorite) and Ice (I like blue, eyes are cool <i>[ba dum tss]</i>). ~~But I have no real incentive to leave Plague, and the flight change fee is a big deterrent, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯~~
	- October 2024 update: Lately I've been itching for change. Lightning of all flights is calling out for some reason. <em style="font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">Spreadsheets.</em>
- My overall favorite breeds are never consistent, but I am ever a sucker for male-pose spirals and aethers. Smiley noodles and doofy bugs <3
