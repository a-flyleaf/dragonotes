Picks up where [the previous page]({%include url.html%}/v1/about/badges) left off, kind of. That page was most actively updated between 2015 and early 2022; I'm not sure if I just didn't *do* badge-related stuff between then and the following, or if I did but didn't track it :I

Oh well. As of October&nbsp;2024, here we go again...!

- Ordered chronologically by date earned, which is based on the event's end date (typically a Saturday).
- Images have **not** been reuploaded and may break later.
- Artist credit in alt text, also visible on hover.
- If I earned multiple badges, I usually grab the one that gets me the most bragging rights (e.g. between exalting 1 dragon per day or 100 dragons total, I'll clip to the 100).
	- If badges are *not* tiered, I use whichever unlocked option is most aesthetically pleasing to me.
- Badge images link to forum threads, some of which aren't visible to those outside the Plague flight. If the **title** is clickable, *then* it's publicly-viewable.
