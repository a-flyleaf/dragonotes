Much as thumbnail collecting go brr and the "must snag one of everything" urge is real, dragons are the ultimate reason I'm here, so I've decided to ditch/de-prioritize all item-based goals. (Spreadsheets exist for those but as of writing (March 2023) haven't been updated in a while..\..)

update 2025&nbsp;January: *Mega item hell spreadsheet updated.* Not currently open to the public, but maybe I'll make a copy for sharing eventually.
