<span class="sc">What *is* a dragon?</span> Draconic denizens of Sornieth don’t all have scales, horns, or even claws. Many fly; some are landbound despite their wings (and rumors stir of forgotten species that lacked even those). For any trait that seems to describe dragons as a species\*, there are too many exceptions to ignore. And this doesn’t even *touch* on Sornieth’s [other wildlife](/lore/world#beastclans).

<sub>*Whether dragons can even be considered a “species” is a contentious issue in its own right. For clarity’s sake, we’ll refer to dragons as a whole a “species,” and the distinct types encompassed by thereof “<a href="/lore/world#breeds">breeds</a>,” even if they lack reproductive compatibility.</sub>

There is but one obvious and indisputable fact about dragonkind, however: they are this world’s **dominant species**. Which is an impressive feat indeed, considering the sheer size of [the Sornieth supercontinent](/lore/world#sornieth); the planet itself is imbued with seemingly endless [magical energies](/lore/world#magic), and appears to be ever-expanding. Dragons do not fear overpopulation any more than they fear [death of old age](/lore/world#age). Magic pulses through their veins from the moment their eggs are [formed](/lore/world#reproduction)—and unlike other creatures, their [elemental](/lore/world#elements) potential is reflected in their eyes. Perhaps this innate elemental specialization is what distinguishes dragons from all other species.

In fact, dragons can seem *so* specialized, one may be left wondering how they leave the in-group at all. Many a century ago, the idea of a mono-elemental or mono-breed lair was unthinkable. Clans were a single species of a single element. Crossover was dangerous, if not outright lethal, simply because dragons were not adapted to living outside their respective environments; a Nature dragon in the Scarred Wasteland would perish quickly indeed, and a Water dragon would be foolish to trek to the crags of Dragonhome. Communication between breeds was also difficult; not impossible, but rarely worthwhile.

BUT. Just look at any given lair nowadays, and you'll see quite the opposite. Clans today are frequently distinguished by the presence of multiple breeds and/or multiple elements; many if not all dragons integrated within Sornieth’s larger culture speak a [common draconian](/lore/world#language). Movement between territories is hindered only by one’s own willpower and physical ability. And inherent elemental dangers are next to nil.

So if specialization isn’t the key to dragons’ global dominance, what is? Having lived among and carefully studied dragonkind for ages, as a sort of draconic anthropologist, I still can’t say for certain. But I have a guess:

Cooperation.

The start of a new\* draconic lineage begins with the foundation of a clan. This is often (but not always\**) facilitated by a pair of “common” breed dragons, known henceforth as [progens](/lore/world#progens), and their first nest together. Unrelated dragons are drawn to this isolated, growing family, and thus a kinship both biological and found is forged. A clan is born.

<sub>\*Some clans still roam the endless wilds of Sornieth, living in ways not unlike their earliest ancestors. It’s difficult to determine the ratio of “wild” dragons to “modern” clans—but if the endless influx of eggs without recorded parents is any indication, the lesser-known clans are hardly in poor shape.</sub>

<sub>\**One progen may be [exalted](/lore/world#exaltation) early in the clan’s development, if not immediately then often after the pair’s nest hatches. In most cases, the remaining progen remains firmly attracted to life in modern Sornieth. But on extremely rare occasions, both progens will seek exaltation, and the clan will be founded instead by other [clanless dragons](/lore/world#travelers).</sub>

The point I’m getting at is that dragons, or at least a majority of those we hear about, are more interconnected than ever before. It is this common ground, this link to the rest of Sornieth, whether on record or not, that unites dragonkind. Had there not been a progen duo or two or twenty, ages upon ages ago, facilitating this level of inter-group communication, Sornieth today might be a completely different world.

But I’ve said quite enough as-is. This alone offers several venues into specific areas of my research, all of which you are welcome and in fact encouraged to explore. I share these writings in hopes of interesting and perhaps inspiring you, and I hope you have as much fun reading (and perhaps [engaging with](/lore/about#can-i-use-this-for-my-own-lore) these digital paper trails as I’ve had writing them.
