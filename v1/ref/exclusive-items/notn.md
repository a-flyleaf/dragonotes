**Night of the Nocturne** is an annual **two-week** event that features the release of several new apparel sets, familiars, and vistas, along with cycling in previous years' new items.

The **fastest and easiest way** to get NotN gear is by grinding the Coliseum, which can drop familiars *and* Strange Chests. Chests have a random chance of dropping **any NotN item**, including [Nocturne eggs](https://www1.flightrising.com/game-database/item/7691), [Nocturne breed change scrolls](https://www1.flightrising.com/game-database/item/7692), and [the tertiary gene Smirch](https://www1.flightrising.com/game-database/item/25153). You can also get Chests through **Swipp**, **brewing**, and (random chance) **Gathering**.

Lag is common on the first few days. Hang in there.

## Item Catalog

[Has been moved to **a spreadsheet**!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10p5NiG6_1LdvtF_Dyvu4-frcKwUepDkGl46hX440vGc/edit?usp=sharing) This page will probably be repurposed eventually, to encompass information about *all* yearly events that aren't elemental festivals. For more info on the move to Google Sheets, see [the Specialty items page]({%include url.html%}/v1/ref/specialty).
