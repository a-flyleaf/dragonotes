title: notes for dragons

And then, at roughly 7PM on December 9, 2019, I got the ridiculous idea to make all my FR stuff its own website. I totally won’t regret this at all.

<b>June 16, 2021:</b> Stopped updating the database stuff in [October/November 2020](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2678477/35), but leaving it up for archival. A majority of edits are personal goal updates now.

<b>October 10, 2021:</b> Did some housekeeping. Maybe I will slowly revive this thing.

<b>August 28, 2022</b>: <em style="font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">Or maybe I'll redo it all. Who knows. Ha. ha ha ha---</em>
