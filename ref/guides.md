Links of varying usefulness. **Not** comprehensive; [the guide forum](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde) is an endless source of helpful knowledge!

## Guides & Reference

- **[75000 treasure in 30 minutes and less](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2518295)**
	
	The ultimate guide to maxing out your Fairgrounds Lucky Streak, thanks to Glimmer & Gloom pattern-matching. There are several variations on the technique, if this particular guide doesn't suit your needs, but I *definitely* recommend getting the hang of this.

- **[Baldwin's Bubbling Brew Visual Guide 3.0](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2135917)**

	Created before you could view Baldwin recipes before unlocking them, but still a *very* useful reference; includes an FAQ, material drop chances, item search reference, and a breakdown of multi-step recipes (ex. to get such-and-such familiar, you need a Glass Beaker, and to get *that* you need…)
	
	Also, for even faster reference: **Food = Goo**, **Material=Ooze**, **Apparel=Slime** (black/grey/white), **Familiar = Muck** (bronze/silver/gold), and **Other = Sludge**.

- **[Chronological update reference](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2292781)**
	
	The entirety of FR's newspost history, summarizing the big developments. Great for quickly seeing when *that one thing* was released, and/or catching up after a hiatus.
	
- **[Coli Builds 2.0](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2441268)**
	
	Once you get the hang of the Coliseum (see below), here's a comprehensive linkhub of different ways to stat your dragons.

- **[Familiar Tracker for collectors](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2158659)**
	
	The Bestiary used to not let you search or filter your familiars & listed them all by name, hoard order and bonding status be darned. Those were dark times.
	
	Spreadsheets like these filled that gap. It also condenses some information that would be a pain to track down individually in the Database otherwise, like **which familiars have been retired/cycled out** and **where/how they can be obtained**.

- **[Gathering Reference](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2317182)**
	
	Maintained by a moderator, it's every*thing* you can get every*where.* Like the Database at a glance.
	
- **[How to Train Your Dragon, By Duke](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/1040710)**
	
	Widely-considered **required reading** for anyone looking to use the Coliseum, for lack of official guidance. Although (as of this writing) it hasn't been updated since 2017, a *vast* majority of the information is still up-to-date, and it contains the **simplest builds for farming and fodder grinding**. (What do those terms mean? *~Read to find out~*)

## Useful threads
- **[Adopt-a-Dragon](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/drt/2157925)** & **[Free Dragon Hub](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/drt/1841235)**

	There are countless dragon giveaway threads, but I'm listing these two specifically because **anyone can list their dragon(s) for non-exalt homes** and thus they're less likely to go inactive in the near future. The first is more active than the second; listers often (but don't always!) crosspost.

- **[Site Status/News Alerts](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2678477)**
	
	A **publially-maintained** thread that takes advantage of forum subscriptions to deliver news updates directly to your inbox. (You might see me pop up here every once in a while; anyone is free to contribute, just make sure you're not double-posting first!)

### Single-user-run services

Services that, despite activity being entirely up to one user, have been 1) active for years and 2) extremely useful in my personal experience.

- **[Familiar Trading Hub](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/ibaz/2189722)**
	
	For non-boss Coliseum familiars.

- **[Flipp's Supplementary Swap Stand](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/ibaz/1935358)**
	
	Any/all Swipp trades, any time.
	
- **[raptorix's free dragons](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/drt/1311647)**
	
	Another dragon giveaway, but with a twist: if you breed the dragon(s) from this thread, raptorix will buy a bab back!

- +an assormtent of dom discount shops; see [the gene page]({%include url.html%}/ref/genes) for details

## Offsite
- **[Flight Rising Wiki](https://flightrising.fandom.com/wiki/Flight_Rising_Wiki)**
	
	The original (and only?) publically-sourced FR guide, while it may be outdated on some pages it's still an invaluable resource. Includes but far from limited to the ever-timely [apparel slot costs](https://flightrising.fandom.com/wiki/Apparel#Apparel_Slots), [color wheel + hexadecimal (Basic) accent codes](https://flightrising.fandom.com/wiki/Colors#Color_Wheel), and [exaltation payout chart](https://flightrising.fandom.com/wiki/Exalting_Dragons#Exaltation_Payout_by_Level).
	
- [Straif's **breeding stat card generator**](http://keelanrosa.com/fr/)
	
	Generates a basic breeding card displaying two dragons' images, color ranges, and gene/breed odds. (If you've looked around hatcheries at all, you've probably seen one or two of these!)
	
- [Peixes' **color range generator**](http://fr.fintastic.net/)
	
	TL;DR of the color wheel: hatchling colors are randomized based on the parents' range. This lets you see them at a glance.

- [Sylvandyr's **coliseum skills + enemy stats**](https://fir-fr-coli-skills.firebaseapp.com/)
	
	Displays some basic Coliseum enemy stats, most importantly including the minimum amount of STR needed for a knockout. For technical explanations, see [the forum guide](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/967048).
	
- [Akrona's **size comparison tool**](https://emcall.github.io/dragonsizes/)
	
	A fun tool that generates an infinitely-resizable page comparing your dragons' sizes. (Breeds are only available up to and including Bogsneak.)
