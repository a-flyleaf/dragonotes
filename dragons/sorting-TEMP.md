link these in the footer; for the details, rather than an obtrusive "all by element" or other page link, just link the h4 to the respective page (e.g. Earth > dragons/elements#earth)

- [ ] page: by element
- [ ] page: by breed (get rid of the "none!" in the details, add a note on the page itself
	- bonus points if there's a lil table with the sizes under each breed, for comparison's sake
- [ ] page: by lore affiliation
	- Viral Evolution
	- The Inn
	- [other lore?]
		- like. Incessant Inferno, Cryptocelus, the reapening, baneclan Airborne Contagion; the interim is a clusterfuck BUT as far as "major groups that both dominated my lair at the time of activity + have far-reaching affiliations," this works ok-ish I guess. Pestilence will have both lol
	- no lore
		- song
- [ ] page: by generation
	- with a manual bit for non-G1s I've gened to some degree; as of writing (2023/11/20) + from memory, consists of: maybe Delphi someday, <b>Comet</b>, Jester, Falsework, maybe dashcon, ...huh that's a small amount tbh I expected more
- [ ] page: by level (coli bar spotlight for 25, smaller highlight for >2, everyone else can be a text list)
- [ ] page: art lol (mostly for my own reference & linkage for art games; dragons with art can be there too but under a details, maybe just avatar + art count)
