Sniped [from a 100-question thread](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/frd/3098860)! For lack of a Single Coherent Clan‚Ñ¢ I‚Äôm skipping a bunch.<!--more-->

<div id="loredoc" markdown="1">
### Are certain things more valuable than currency that would be used as such?
Some dragons follow economics; by default, most don‚Äôt. Good ol‚Äô-fashioned bartering, whether for labor or food or supplies, is just as if not *more* common than currency, and plenty of dragons just use what the environment gives them.

That said, there *is* a mild instinctual draw to shinies (treasure/gems). Like, who made these? They are cool. Primal instinct to lie on a pile. Most dragons find this easy to ignore, if it‚Äôs detectable at all, but it *is* possible.

### Does your clan get along [with] Beastclans or are they all enemies?
Frankly I ignore the Beastclan side of the site more often than not; no offense to them or Beastclan enjoyers, but I‚Äôm here for the *dragons*, dangit >:V

[Recent retcons](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/ann/3193191) have sort of validated my approach to Beastclans in that, in my lore, they‚Äôre not in some constant eternal conflict with dragonkind. But since I‚Äôm not fussed about incorporating them more than that, I kinda just assume they‚Äôre off in their own societal pockets, doing their own things. *Sometimes* one or a few will team up with dragons but it‚Äôs an exception, not the norm.

Also, far as the Coliseum is concerned, I take a similar approach as I did with Pok√©mon (in worlds where the pok√©mon are essentially sapient but trainers are also a thing): there are designated zones where dragons (trainers & teams) and other flora/fauna/beings (wild ‚Äômon) frequently meet up to ‚Äúspar,‚Äù a global norm (sport) that, on paper, benefits both parties. Yes, the win ratio is skewed heavily in favor of the dragons, *but* not all dragons battle (in fact most don‚Äôt), so those who do become a self-selected population of weirdly-jacked fighting enjoyers.

It‚Äôs controversial in-universe, yes.

### Does your clan celebrate the Elemental Holidays? Why or why not?
I‚Äôve always liked the idea (seen ages ago, possibly on tumblr, but not sure of the specific source) that dragons have a form of astrology based on the seasons, though I‚Äôve never developed my own version much. Maybe worth doing, while I revisit my lair? ü§î

Anyway, the Holidays are very much a thing, and also known globally; to what extent dragons *celebrate* is, as with many things, up to specific cultures. But even the most wild-living dragon will have *some* passing awareness of these seasons; that element‚Äôs magic can feel stronger (though it‚Äôs typically placebo), and sometimes dragons are afflicted with new visual conditions (skins & accents, babey) around this time of year. And Night of the Nocturne, of course, brings with it beasts and chests and random eggs aplenty *seriously where do all these eggs come from are exalted nocturnes just getting together for Sornieth‚Äôs biggest Easter hunt what gives.*

### Can all forms of elemental magic heal?
This one‚Äôs interesting! I don‚Äôt see why not, tbh? Nature‚Äôs a go-to, but let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶.
- **Earth** healers who have mineral-based cures and ointments that *sound* like New Age-y nonsense but, because this is fantasy dragon magic, they actually work
- **Fire** healers whose warmth can act as an instant fever, saving the ill days of stuffy-nosed agony in favor of a quick burst of germ-be-gone
- **Wind** healers who can move pains and ailments through the body like leaves in the air; objectively, it might not be a cure, but it certainly makes the healing period more bearable
- **Water** healers with soothing abilities akin to Wind‚Äôs, but throw in some good ocean-based remedies, and maybe some mystic promises for good measure
- **Shadow** healers who‚Ä¶ uh, take the issue and move it somewhere else? Okay NGL I‚Äôm drawing a blank here but surely those shrooms can do *something* :B
- **Ice** healers specialize in the opposite of Wind and Water‚Äôs calm: look no further than the Tundra for instant, frigid numbness, and bonus points if it works well with Fire for magic-based frostbite+cauterization combos that will only sting a little
- **Lightning** healers, naturally, believe there‚Äôs nothing technology can‚Äôt fix, whether it‚Äôs imported chemicals from other lands being synthesized into pebble-looking medications to the best artificial limbs Sornieth has to offer
- **Light** healers who‚Ä¶ ok for some reason my first thought was x-ray vision, they can ~shine a light~ on physical ailments and such. Probably they have better *documentation* of medical knowledge than actual cures; all the paper, see other flights for practice.
- **Nature** healers are the classic flower-toting hippies who slather some mystical plants on a wound and *bam* you‚Äôre cured
- **Plague** healers have an unfortunate reputation for hurting more than they help, but a willingness to experiment with substances no other flight would dream of touching can prove quite bountiful
- **Arcane** healers, meanwhile, are the *real* wild cards, drawing on occult powers that not even *they* understand‚Äîfor remedies that might work, but have just as high a chance of unexpected, erm, *side effects*

‚Ä¶Yeah!! Also, should be noted here and elsewhere: I assume generalizations like this are just that, generalizations, and have about as much accuracy as (for instance) ‚ÄúAmericans are loud.‚Äù There might be some truth to it rooted in cultural norm, but it‚Äôs a mistake to think it‚Äôs universally-applicable; misinformed at best, willfully ignorant at worst.

Be nice to your local Plague Doctor.

### Is all magic absolutely elemental (strictly to the in-game lore magics) or are there general forms of magic any dragon can use? If so, how do they work?
I feel like the existence of non-elemental battlestones suggests that, yes, some generic form of magic exists. Not particularly interested in worldbuilding it right now, but it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that, as with many things in life, the boundaries between ‚Äúelemental‚Äù magic and ‚Äúregular‚Äù magic (and between those elemental types) are less clear than everyone likes to assume.

### Do dragon[s] have to be in certain conditions to be able to perform their magic? (Ex. An Ice or Nature dragon would not be able to perform their abilities in the Ashfall Wastes.)
I have not considered this before but it‚Äôs an interesting thought! I want to say it‚Äôs not *im*possible but it‚Äôs going to be *difficult*, with a rough correlation to the elemental dis/advantages. A weak or beginning magic-user might be totally incapacitated in a foreign land, whereas one with more experience could conjure flowers in the Scarred Wasteland. (Not that said flowers would live long, if not tended to, but it‚Äôs *possible*.)

### Can a dragons magic become naturally more powerful over time or would they need any form of training to help them become more powerful?
Hm, I want to say it‚Äôs a mix of inborn and how any skill is learned. With no training, a dragon might get gradually better over time from sheer exposure, but the hypothetical graph is flat and can even dip if they‚Äôre not honing it. But training is a pretty clear upwards curve. That‚Äôs how learning works!

### In-game lore says only water can be seers, but can any dragon be able to do the same regardless of element? How do they receive future prophecies without the influence of a Deity?
I don‚Äôt feel like going flight-by-flight but, in case it‚Äôs not already clear, I barely use in-game lore. Some things stick out to me that might not be intuitive otherwise (Lightning and work, Water and prophecies) but otherwise it‚Äôs <span style="display:inline-block;">¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</span>. The caveat above wrt generalizations applies, too; Water might be *known for* oracular inclinations, but it‚Äôd be silly to think they all are or even *want to* pursue the omens.

Also, just in general, I roll with the idea that deities are schr√∂dinger‚Äôs reality; for lack of other evidence it can be *assumed* they created the world and all, but no one‚Äôs ever seen them except the exalted and exalted dragons almost never return. I‚Äôve rambled a bit about this and dragon longevity [on my loredump thread](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/qnc/3072455/9#post_49623459), so I won‚Äôt get into it again here, but suffice it to say: If the deities were real, why don‚Äôt they talk to us (anymore)?!

Seers in any flight receive prophecies like they might read tea leaves: with a hefty dose of confirmation bias. But to their credit, because this is also magical fantasy world, maybe it‚Äôs not *all* woo.

### Can dragons use magic to shape or create things?
*Hypothetically,* yes. But for ease of worldbuilding (‚Äúwhy not just magic everything????‚Äù) the longevity of magically-created items may be limited. A magic-made statue, say, may be more susceptible to wear and tear than something forged from stone and flame. Reverse plastic antics.

Also, you cannot magic into existence a fully-fledged sapient being. Nests are one thing (which I will not be getting into), recurring ephemeral companions can exist (think apparel like the Vials), but you can‚Äôt just spawn a dragon or cerdae or what have you. That‚Äôs a hard limit. And relatedly:

### Can one[‚Äô]s magic influence or read someone[‚Äô]s mind?
*Influence,* why not. *Read* might be going too far. These are both strictly within Arcane realms and *extremely* rare, if possible at all.

I‚Äôm thinking something like‚Äîa dragon could try to influence another by making themself more attractive or convincing, or by negatively-affecting the listener (making them tired, using a magic aphrodisiac), but there‚Äôs no ‚Äúbam, you believe in aliens now‚Äù shortcut. Even then, you have to be specific, and the effects may have unintended consequences; ‚ÄúI make myself attractive‚Äù manifests as, say, ‚ÄúI make my scales shinier,‚Äù and the other dragon actually really likes matte textures & finds the new gleam blinding and leaves. Similarly, ‚ÄúI make myself more convincing‚Äù is translated as ‚ÄúI can suddenly remember all the facts‚Äù but maybe this wasn‚Äôt about logic at *all,* Janet, I want to hear you *feel something.*

Far as mind-reading goes, I want to say the best is like, Enhanced Vibe Detection, like a Perception check. It heightens your awareness of body language cues (but even those can be misread), tone and word choice (but your biases can come into play), and in general you‚Äôre just never going to get a clear stream of dialogue or motivational cues. People don‚Äôt always think in discernible, defined words or even visuals anyway‚Ä¶.

### Are there dragons dedicated to convincing others to serve their deities?
Gonna take a moment to talk about **flight representatives**, since they‚Äôve come up a couple times among my lizards ([Drosera](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/12989339) is/was a Nature one, and [Lux](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/14562462) was supposed to be for Light): They‚Äôre somewhere between diplomats and missionaries. The degree to which they are obnoxious about it, and how formalized the whole arrangement is, varies by clan, but there *is* a generally-known idea of Dragon Who Represents X Flight and May Travel to Blab About It.

Among the missionary-types, ‚Äúyou should be following *my* deity, actually‚Äù is, well, basically in the job description. But the cultural exchange can also be for its own sake, whether akin to attending a wedding in a foreign culture (you‚Äôve been invited! be respectful and all should be well, they *want* to show you what they do) or being an ambassador for that Chinese-American shop down the street (hey, it counts).

[later note] Ohh, there‚Äôs a blatant question about ambassadors/representatives way later. Clan-specific, though. Ah well <span style="display:inline-block;">¬Ø\\\_( :V )_/¬Ø</span>

### What is exalting to your clan/dragons exactly? Is it noble? Foolish? + How does one go about exalting another? Is it a ritual? A process? Does one decide for themself and leave? Does another help[?] + Where would one go to be exalted?
*Oh ok nvm there‚Äôs exalting questions in here,* OK SO. Going to address all these at once, sort of, in a general infodump about the subject!

First and foremost: Dragons don‚Äôt die. Or rather, they can fall to disease, physical force (killed, drowning, buried alive, etc.), and occasionally ‚Äúold age‚Äù‚Äîbut it‚Äôs hypothesized that dragons could theoretically live forever. And while the population of those who‚Äôve been around since ‚Äúthe beginning‚Äù is small, it *does* exist; it‚Äôs how dragonkind knows the deities *did* speak, once (even if it seems filtered through the generations to its own dubiously-true mythos), knows about them at all.

Dragons can also breed like rabbits, should they choose. There‚Äôs no age cutoff. The population could expand, and slowly *is* expanding, exponentially.

‚ÄúExaltation,‚Äù as it‚Äôs been known since The Old Times, is framed as a way for a dragon, any dragon (old age not required), to serve a deity‚Äîat the low and humble price of being cut off from their kin forever. No one knows exactly what happens to the exalted, and the population of those who‚Äôve returned is too small to draw any solid conclusions. In this way it‚Äôs effectively death, philosophical arguments aside.

But the trouble is that it doesn‚Äôt necessarily *involve* death. Certainly, there are groups that consider exaltation but a nicer word for the matter; whether this means their exaltees are sacrificed at the altar or if they deem exaltation deeply immoral or anything in between is, of course, a matter of cultural belief. Yet many perfectly happy dragons have decided they‚Äôd like to be exalted, and off proudly they go, and they‚Äôre simply never heard from again *but no one who‚Äôs seen them can confirm they died.*

It‚Äôs a schr√∂dinger‚Äôs existence‚Äîfitting enough, really. Even those who try to follow an exaltee can only go so far; at some point the dragon simply disappears, and yes, it‚Äôs disconcerting.

On a more hopeful note, some say this is where all the damn orphaned eggs come from.

### Do dragons that come back from exalting seen as higher or lesser for leaving/being kicked out?
Not really answering the question (again: It Is Cultural), but a relevant thought‚Äî Some stories from those returned from exaltation include:
- I can‚Äôt tell if I was dissociating/tripping that whole time
- \*has no memory of the event\*
- Actually, I *did* see the Arcanist, and he said I was his favorite and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm back to talk to you all and‚Äî
- That was *actually* the face of death incarnate and I simply said no thank you
- That was *actually* the face of death incarnate and I had a lovely cruise down the draconic Styx but simply decided to disboard
- I ascended to a higher plane of existence but missed you guys :(((
- But seriously, where *did* my whole childhood go?!

Ask a thousand ex-exaltees, get a thousand different answers.

### Are any breed stronger than another in any way? Or are all breeds equal?
Different Breeds Are Good At Different Things, this goes kind of without saying. An undertide is going to have *immense difficulty* with things made for hands, but a skydancer will never fit as smoothly down an underwater tunnel system, and probably wouldn‚Äôt consider writing with the tail as a first instinct.

‚ÄúStrength‚Äù is subjective etc etc. Starting coli stats are probably a good approximation of each breed‚Äôs respective affinitie.

### Can breeds of their "origin element" use their magic better? (Ex. A spiral dragon using wind magic better because the breed originated from Wind more than say a guardian dragon using wind magic)
This might have been true at one time but all breeds and elements have been crossed to hell and back, so, no, there‚Äôs no inherent advantage. (Placebo‚Äôs a heck of a drug, though.)

### Are your dragon sizes more to that of in-game canon (Fae is the smallest, Imperial the biggest, etc.) or are they closer together?
*Honestly it‚Äôs whatever I feel like at the time.* The cross-dilution thing applies, too; a fae with only fae in the lineage will probably (but not necessarily!) be tiny, a mixed-lineage or even breed-changed one will almost definitely be bigger, etc.

As a default I figure they‚Äôre all around, uh‚Ä¶ horse?? Large Mammal but not necessarily megafauna. There‚Äôs a pretty wide range among breeds, though, and the bell curve has a very gentle slope.

### Are all dragons similarly expressive or do they all uniquely show their emotions?
Unique, babey. Far as body language and humanesque expressions go, I defer to talking animal stories; you‚Äôll just *notice* tail and wing movements more on these creatures, so they play a larger role in expressiveness, but more sociable dragons will still tend to emote like humans (baring teeth with a mouth curved up *can* be a smile, not a snarl) because this is human imagination for a human audience.

It‚Äôs like the currency thing; anthropomorphization may vary, but it‚Äôs almost always *there*. (There are probably hordes of ‚Äúwild‚Äù dragons with none of these trappings. Hey, is that what happens to the exalted‚Äî?!)

### Are your dragons able to fly? Or is wholly determined by their wing sizes?
A funny thing about Flight Rising is that it looks like it‚Äôs basically mandatory for a dragon to have wings (‚Äúwingspan‚Äù being one of the measurements), even if they technically function more as fins (hi, undertides). I can‚Äôt *really* imagine an undertide flying, but veilspun wing proportions don‚Äôt exactly scream ‚Äúthey can flutter like pixies‚Äù to me either, and magic is real so like *what the hell*. (Also, something something a realistic dragon wing size, via laws of physics and no magic, would be *flipping huge*, and that‚Äôs just not super feasible for either visual appeal or actual survivable realism. They‚Äôre like bees, in that way. ~~But not yellow or black (necessarily).~~)

Anyway, the breeds have their own inborn affinities (spirals and fae with the air, snappers and tundras nigh-landbound, undertides in the sea), and they‚Äôre stronger among Ancients, but generalizations are generalizing and such and whatnot. Magic‚Äôs real. May snappers and undertides soar to their heart‚Äôs content (with magical help, but still).

### Can your Ancient and Modern dragons breed with each other despite in-game lore?
*Nah,* and in general I defer to site mechanics above anything. Not to *such* a literal extent that the Auction House exists, because *that‚Äôs* an ethical can of worms that I‚Äôm not touching (also FR ToS are a thing), but I try not to flat-out *contradict* what the game actually says is/n‚Äôt possible.

### How did you clan react to finding Ancients?
So Ancients are funny because they represent *massive* lore ‚Äúretcons,‚Äù in a way; dragons who are Actually Old (born in 2013, when the site began) will have zero concept of their existence, but the whole conceit of the Ancients (so far, anyway, but also kind of a given right there in the name) is that they‚Äôve been around since the beginning.

There‚Äôs also the matter of how Ancients have been *released*; you can absolutely hatch a G1 banescale that‚Äôs never been anything but, whereas gaolers, veilspun, and undertides have all been introduced via breed change. I‚Äôve only really fleshed out the banescale introduction (in large part because I was actively conjuring lore at the time), and that kinda came down to ‚Äúsure, broad game canon strokes of ‚Äòlost species now rediscovered‚Äô tracks‚Äù and rolling with it.

*The others, though.* Okay, I haven‚Äôt written anything about it down, but here‚Äôs a thought: ancient tomes discovered, science/magic advanced far enough to make their revival possible, but in the way that cloning a woolly mammoth is a ‚Äúrevival‚Äù‚Äîyou gotta start *somewhere,* and that‚Äôs inevitably going to influence the result. The gaolers, veilspun, and undertides we know today might not be *exactly* like their supposed kin of yore, but they *exist,* and that‚Äôs as good as dragonkind can get. (Well, for now. Maybe someday we‚Äôll get Ancient eggs for existing breeds, but I ain‚Äôt counting on it‚Ä¶.)

### What about the Obelisks?
*NGL I wasn‚Äôt active for that whole event,* sad face :(. They, uh, were formed of statues, I think? something something Earthshaker and everyone had to dig all archaeology-style? Man, I don‚Äôt know, but I only have [one obelisk](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/48734092) anyway and he was breed-changed.

‚ÄîBut oh yeah, this question follows one about Ancints and culture, and to that I say: as with all things, ~it‚Äôs variable~, *but* Ancients tend strongly towards not liking apparel. It‚Äôs not *impossible* (accents exist), that‚Äôs silly, but they *do* struggle to find apparel fashioned for their body types. And at any rate, homogenous clans are an exception, not the norm by a long, *long* shot.

### Do dragons mate for life or no?
If it‚Äôs not gameplay-restricted, it‚Äôs possible in lore. That said, ‚Äúprogen‚Äù pairs are a weirdly frequent phenomenon, and they have a higher rate of being exclusive life partners than any given pairup.

### Do dragons look down on others for not having a lineage? (G1 dragons)
Bias handwave aside, G1s in my lore are basically just orphans, and there‚Äôs nothing inherently special about them except that they couldn‚Äôt track down their parents if they tried. They also seem to have ‚Äúpurer‚Äù versions of their element and (starting) breed‚Äôs attributes; it‚Äôs a trend, not a rule, but a trend indeed. (For instance: I might add a feature or two from a ‚Äúmixed-breed‚Äù dragon‚Äôs parents when drawing them, like stubby horns on a spiral/snapper noodle, but G1s refer solely to the site art as given.)

*Progens* are special, though. It‚Äôs not a formal term, but there is a disproportionate amount of orphans with dubious recollections of their past who found a clan together. Usually they‚Äôre mates; sometimes they‚Äôre siblings, and any other relationship under the sun is technically possible. But if one were to conduct a survey on every single dragon everywhere, ‚Äúprogens‚Äù would be an undeniable trend.

An early tidbit of my personal lore: my own progens, [Maelstrom](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/12116084) and [Lapilli](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/12116085), recall having clans not unlike those described by the Encyclopedia (a roving swarm of mirrors for Maelstrom, a sap-cured tree for Lapilli) and the dissolution of said clans (the pack crumbled in the face of interpersonal conflict; the tree was felled and its inhabitants scattered), but if they tried to remember *where* they were from they‚Äôd draw complete blanks. It‚Äôs as though they one day just‚Ä¶ *spawned.* And then they met, and the rest is history, but it‚Äôs strange and mildly disconcerting that everything before then is such a blur.

Lapilli tried to look into that once. She didn‚Äôt get anywhere and ultimately decided it didn‚Äôt matter, not compared to living in the moment and continuing her travels with Maelstrom (the search took her deeper into places than Maelstrom cared to follow, and they‚Äôve always been inseparable), but it still irks her sometimes.

### Are your dragons in your lore, anthro, human, or just simply dragon?
Simply dragon! Anthros are a fun thought sometimes, even the rare humansona, but only for one-off art. Their characters might be effectively humans in draconic skin (I rarely account for like, the influence of Having Wings and Real Magic on psychology), but I‚Äôm here for that draconic skin and not in-depth worldbuilding, y‚Äôfeel?

### How technologically advanced is your clan? Do they use magic to fuel technology? or just simply magic for all necessary things?
Adjacent questions on ‚Äúhuman/animal‚Äù lifestyle divides have already been covered, more or less (It Depends‚Ñ¢), but this one stuck out because like‚Ä¶ why magic *vs* technology? Why not magic *in* technology?? Technology fueled by magic and vice versa. Lightning might be most gung-ho on magic-free tech, as a ~~bragging right~~ perpetual self-challenge, but there really doesn‚Äôt need to be a binary here. ~~When does there ever lol~~

### What does your clan do with abandoned eggs?
I imagine that abandoned eggs that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù become like, those G1 hoards collecting virtual dust in people‚Äôs sales tabs and dens and such; they hatch, they grow, and then they don‚Äôt really do anything.

That wasn‚Äôt really a lore tidbit, I just thought it was a funny mental image :V They Are Just Vibing.

### Are there any planets that your dragons, or others, have found?
*Christ, no.* Or like, maybe *someone* out there somewhere, but it‚Äôs not a field my dragons are into because To Be Frank, Sornieth is *more* than enough ground to cover as-is xux‚Äù

On which note‚Äîthe World Map of Sornieth, even the updated one with zooming and animations, is still simplified. This planet‚Äôs frickin‚Äô *huge*. I have no concept for how travel would take using a realistic global scale but we‚Äôre not here for that anyway. There are *countless* sub-regions and cities and towns and wildernesses etc. etc. etc. and it is all so I can niftily handwave the sheer scope and variety of lore across the site that somehow inexplicably rarely rubs shoulders with anyone else.

### Sorneith canonically has 2 moons. What would they be named if your clan had to name them?
*Sornieth canonically has two moons?!???!?*

### Is the Shade feared in your clan? Anyone "Shade-Touched"?
Shade stuff kind of bores me NGL. Dark edgy shadow group is Right There, it‚Äôs *called* Shadow, this feels redundant. (I know there‚Äôs world-founding lore here but again, not super relevant to my interests and dubiously true anyway.) That said, here‚Äôs a spontaneous thought:

I like the idea ‚Äúthe Shade‚Äù is something of a go-to ‚Äúevil.‚Äù Want to scare hatchlings into staying out of trouble? Stay in line, or *the Shaaaade* will catch you. Having a bad day? Dammit, Shade. Someone acting weird and you don‚Äôt want to acknowledge their state of mind or full humanity (dragonity?) as an individual? LOL, must be Shade-touched!

(No, er, *shade* to Shade-enjoyers. It is just not my thing, this flat Evil Force with no apparent motivation or depth except Cause Problems On Purpose‚Äîa noble pursuit, to be sure, but is entropy alone not enough??)

### What of slang? Or sayings? What about swears? Do certain dragons/ dragons of elements have certain sayings/swears? (Think when the Light Sprite yells "Baku Snout!" in G&G out of frustration)
I wish I had a better mental library of item flavor text to pull this off but *alas.* As-is I will sometimes scour the Game Database for a relevant reference when the need arises, but otherwise I kind of just handwave and assume this is a thing, and maybe it just doesn‚Äôt translate from draconic tongue to Enlgish. F.

### Are fictional books in your lore similar to books in our real life? What about comics and toys?
Given FR‚Äôs baseline not-really-modern setting, I want to say no, but also magic‚Äôs real and dragons can be dextrous so who‚Äôs to say. Honestly, I just don‚Äôt vibe *as much* with, like, dragons in a modern cityscape (although it‚Äôs a fun mental image) compared to all the ~lower-tech and magic-shenanigan ambiguity canon gestures towards.

Also, my lore would change dramatically if these guys had cell phones. Magic mirror-portals, sure, but infernal beeping devices? *Unheard of!* Sounds ~~arcane~~ occult, cursed, what have you! (Good for them!)

### If a dragon was to say try to invent something we have in our modern lives, like a TV or a car, How would other dragons react?
There *must* be a niche for this somewhere but for my own sanity I‚Äôm gonna say it‚Äôs just that, a niche. Why *would* you want flat screens when magic can make ‚Äúholographic‚Äù meatloaf 24/7?? (True to form, any minimalist cities are probably in the Shattered Expanse, or at least the clustered/better-maintained ones are. *It‚Äôs About The Challenge.* (also gdi, now I want a clan/offshoot-region that‚Äôs just Lightning Does/Did A Modernism, and so it‚Äôs very much like a city but with dragons and no cars. but there are gridded roads, inexplicably. *hmm.*))

### Do other forms of dimensions exist?
No, but also yes, because I have a bunch of OC-dragonsonas (author-sanctioned fandragons??) and have given them Sornieth-based lore for fun. I do not cross this over with the rest of the lair. Also, I have ‚Äúsong‚Äù dragons who don‚Äôt have lore like the main lizards either, but I don‚Äôt group them with the OC dragonsona crew. Also also, [Avi](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/26634365) and [Singularity](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/80037268) exist. And so I guess the answer is that there *are* other dimensions, but in the way that you can have a handful of Pok√©mon AUs and they rarely if ever cross over.

### Does any form of heaven or limbo exist in your lore? Or any form of afterlife?
I was going to say no but I actually do have multiple accounts of ghosts in my lore, one from a fandom-knockoff plot that didn‚Äôt go anywhere and more recently from wanting to do something with [Mallow](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/66788485) and also a bunch of exalted ex-keepers who I still fondly remember. So, uh, *shrug??* Ghosts confirmed??? I haven‚Äôt elaborated on *where* they are, though, and kind of just categorically refuse to because it raises too many questions about the deity stuff. They‚Äôre more like‚Ä¶ disembodied consciousnesses, I guess, than anything.

### [Do] spirits exist? Can they possess or move things around?
So the spirits I *do* have are
- [this one fallen empress](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/16213216) who, after death, briefly possessed [a dude I wasn‚Äôt doing much else with](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/31806787), except I lost interest in that subplot and I guess she‚Äôs been exorcized by now or something. RIP
- and disembodied voices that communicate with Mallow, located in a Shadow-Nature borderland wood where, incidentally, the aforementioned empress led her troops and that‚Äôs why many of them died. (I was doing a lair purge, yes.)
Er, actually, maybe the answer is that the spirit stuff has more to do with Vulcan and/or that specific area than it being a general facet of my dragon worldbuilding??

### Are hatchlings assigned a job when they're young or can be anything they please once they're of a certain age?
[Lux](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/14562462) was a hatchling when he left his birth clan to represent Light‚Äîalthough jury‚Äôs still out to what degree that was intended, versus a nosy/curious hatchling going out and getting lost.

At any rate, dragons are hatched basically autonomous, and can theoretically do whatever job they want straight out the egg. It *would* be disorienting, though, and if they fight they don‚Äôt gain anything objective from the experience. (I say this because it doesn‚Äôt make sense for hatchlings to be *entirely barred* from ‚Äúthe Coliseum‚Äù but, well, gameplay. Compromise, then, is that if they *do* battle, they learn [heck]all, because they‚Äôre too physically juvenile for anything to stick.) (*Psychological* scars, of course, can be forever :3)

### Do some dragons sometimes eat outside their food groups? Like a Tundra eating meat/fish?
In another break from gameplay, *sure, why not.* It‚Äôs gonna taste bad though probably, and their teeth are *not* made for it ~~as if tooth types are a thing I pay close attention to in art~~. It is not filling, as a rule, and might actively make them sick. Why would you do this.

### What does your clan do with gene scrolls/breed changes? Are they even a thing? Magic? Can they willingly change their breed at any time using one? Would they still carry characteristics of their old breed after they change? IS it instant? Gradual? Same with genes? Or do the patterns mix for a bit before changing to the new?
HUEHUEHUE ok cool, saved a fun one for last:

Yes, gene and breed changes are very much a thing! Magic-based for sure, and both duration & lingering vestiges of the previous state depend on how well-made the thing is. (Not that it‚Äôs a 1:1 correlation; sometimes a dragon might *want* their old looks to shine through, and use a scroll made accordingly.)

Although realistically all/most dragons might have merged into some kind of landrace by now (and further evolution would be a thing), for simplicity‚Äôs sake I figure both genes and breeds represent recurring prominent patterns; it‚Äôs like if you bred a husky and a dachshund and the puppies were 90% husky OR dachshund, with the 10% being shaggy heterochromic dachshunds and long-bodied floppy-eared huskies. *Little* things might pass down, but the silhouette remains recognizably One Breed.

Genes, meanwhile, are basically always the same, with variations in pattern; there‚Äôs no need for like, XYZ *exact* stripe at this *exact* place across all dragons of a certain breed, and stylization is a thing, but ‚Äúwhat were the parents‚Äô genes tho‚Äù is not something I take into account when drawing so. Individual variation comes down more to, say, ‚Äúspots are bigger/smaller, clustered here or there‚Äù than ‚Äúactually you can see a little Piebald in this Speckle because there are white patches that would look really cool but the site art won‚Äôt allow that and I don‚Äôt want to make myself sad on the What Could Have Been (or, like, drive myself nuts scouring parents for what genes might be coming through from where).‚Äù

Also, the process of changing is different for everyone, based on both the scroll‚Äôs attributes and who the individual is. One dragon‚Äôs days of agony could be another‚Äôs *poof* insta-fix with the same scroll‚Äîalthough generally, it only takes a day or two max for the transformation to complete. It is not, unfortunately, possible to undo the change, but if there are ever second thoughts, one could just find a scroll of the previous version.

(Well, except for imperials. Sorry, imps. Lightweaver has deemed you too dangerous/precious to proliferate so, and thus imposed a global ban from day one. It‚Äôs one of those weird facts of the universe, like having a leap year. Rumor has it imperial scrolls still exist, in black markets for the obscenely rich (who else), but it‚Äôs a total pipe dream for a vast majority of dragonkind nonetheless. Gosh dang ‚ÄúKickstarters,‚Äù whatever that means.)

Let it be known that I scrawled all this up in one long session, which while not the best for my sleep *is* good for this sort of "get everything out while it's fresh in the head" thing. Would be useful to organize all this on ~wiki pages somehow eventually, but hey, for now It's There!

...Maybe I'll have to make another TL;DR post, because I think I'll be referring to some of these concepts a lot üòÖ
