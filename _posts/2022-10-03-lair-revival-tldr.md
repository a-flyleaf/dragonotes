Shorter version of [the last post](lair-revival), since it's 1) kinda redundant with [the new about]({%include url.html%}/about) and 2) long enough that frankly *I* don't feel like going back to it a lot. Essentially:

- I've been on FR for years, lore is scattered (bios, posts, websites, etc.)
- info onsite is more convenient to edit, but might as well use this site for *something*
- am also overwhelmed by sheer number of dragons (>50); want to focus on those instead of constantly getting more
- want to revisit everyone, 1 or <5 at a time
	- lore catalyst: meteor fell, rifts opened, everyone scattered
- will do this revisiting via blog posts here, then compiling info on more completionist pages
- But First, want to overhaul site & catch up with current lair

Bam. Done. \o/

Site overhaul is essentially done too, in the most bare bones pseudo-blog way. Lair catchup is pending because I keep putting off a mini-clearout, but y'know. Soonâ„¢
