Shortly after writing those lair revival posts my focus went all-in on a totally unrelated project-ministory-thing, so it's been quiet here for a while. Finally gonna push an update, so firstly have a couple gameplay notes:

- Decided to hibernate a boatload of dragons, where they'll stay indefinitely because no one said I can't work on them while they're chillin' out there. I have no idea who was active at the time of writing so ixnay on the lair catchup.
- Also woke up some hibernating dragons I'm on the fence about keeping; some might be given away or even exalted wholesale, others might end up returning to the hibden. For now I'm only removing them from the site data if they've actually gone to other people.

To make the whole thing less intimidating for me, in the lore-catchup department, I might have the meteor drop induce some degree of amnesia? Dragons will have faint recollections of old friends/relatives/enemies/etc., but they won't be constantly distressed if it feels like someone was supposed to be there who... isn't, yet. Which is a lil tragic but don't worry, they'll all converge eventually somehow.

[Singularity](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/80037268) will remain The One Who Knows. If all else fails, it's always there.

Ta-ta for now~
