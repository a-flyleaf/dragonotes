- add fancybox (and other additional styling) for photosets
- figure out what to do about one-word titles (by default, title is used for the URL *and* visible in-post & in-tab)
- continue backing up posts chronologically; left off at the bottom of [page 17](https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/page/17)
- tags are going to be A Problem since it's a hodge-podge of rambling and actual categorization. maybe use categories, link those, and use some special code (saw that at one point but didn't save the link) to make it link *only* if the tag is one of several specified?

and then you get to do this all over again for blog#2 8^) have fun!
