Layout based on [a tumblr theme by Dohmalore](https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/127184518325/permafrostimpaler-dohmalores-theme-i-had-a), recoded from scratch by yours truly. Features an edit of the [Bone Fiend](https://www1.flightrising.com/game-database/item/910).

Backgrounds made using
- (main) Wood from Subtle Patterns<!--http://subtlepatterns.com/wood/--> + Rotten Wood from maxTextures; and<!--https://href.li/?http://www.mb3d.co.uk/mb3d/Bark_and_Tree_Seamless_and_Tileable_High_Res_Textures.html-->
- (side) Concrete Seamless from Subtle Patterns<!--http://subtlepatterns.com/concrete-seamless/--> + Aluminum Clean Metal<!--http://www.mb3d.co.uk/mb3d/Metal_Rusty_and_Patterned_Seamless_and_Tileable_High_Res_Textures.html--> from maxTextures.

Links to both exact resources have changed since I originally credited them, but the sites persist at [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns) and [maxTextures](http://www.mb3d.co.uk/maxtextures.html).

Additional shout-out to [this stackOverflow answer about using spaces in tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40117564/jekyll-tags-that-have-spaces-or-multiple-words), and another answer about using subfolders in posts that I immediately lost the link to after using.
