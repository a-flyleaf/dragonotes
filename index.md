And then, at roughly 7PM on December 9, 2019, I got the ridiculous idea to make all my FR stuff its own website. I totally wonâ€™t regret this at all.

<b>June 16, 2021:</b> Stopped updating the database stuff in [October/November 2020](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2678477/35), but leaving it up for archival. Personal goal updates constitute a majority of updates now.
