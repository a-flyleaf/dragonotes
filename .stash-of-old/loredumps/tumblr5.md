# Vulcan’s End, more scattered ideas, and old lore dumping

## 2018 March 9 https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/171687119859

	Late night lore idea spree? Late night lore idea spree!
	
	### Character Basis

	- [Avi](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=26634365): I want to narrate because it’s fun. I believe this because it’s my duty as an avatar. I value humor and factual accuracy.
	
	- [Maelstrom](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116084): I want to travel alone with Lapilli because commitment with anyone else never works out. I believe this because other groups I’ve been in fall apart eventually. I value solitude and survival.
	
	- [Lapilli](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116085): I want to travel with Maelstrom because this status quo is fulfilling and practical. I believe this because we exist to help each other survive. I value leadership and adaptability.
	
	- [Altostratus](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11966926): I want to prove my virtue because villains deserve death. I believe this because I was raised on stories of heroism. I value good intentions and self-preservation.
	
	- [Solar](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=6594794): I want to learn more about the world because everything in it fascinates me. I believe this because magical possibilities seem endless. I value curiosity and guidance. 
	
	- [Pestilence](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13483458): I want to experiment with new substances because it’s been my lifelong solace. I believe this because approval is fickle and friends leave but science is forever. I value autonomy and versatility.
	
	- [Schism](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12788530): I want to serve someone because I crave a sense of belonging. I believe this because a bizarre dragon such as myself needs to justify existing. I value routine and teamwork.
	
	- [Delphi](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=15585543): I want to make myself stronger because it’s all I’m good for. I believe this because I would be unable to live with my murderous past otherwise. I value physical strength and servitude to the deities.
	
	- [Galena](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=20722709): I want to find a new purpose in life because I must be good for more than fighting. I believe this because I was raised to believe otherwise which horrifies me in retrospect. I value freedom and nonviolence.
	
	- [Notturno](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=9359734): I want to sell and trade my wares because reasons. I believe this because I am a dragon capitalist. I value money and more money.
	
	- [Riviana](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=16051687): I want to fight and thrive with Gizmo because living like this makes me happy. I believe this because I just want a friend. I value loyalty and perseverance.
	
	- [Gizmo](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=18345336): I want to tinker and thrive with Riv because living in the Workshop with her makes me happy. I believe this because I am a robot and this is fun. I value companionship and mechanics.
	
	- [Fern](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13567780): I want to travel because I can’t stand staying in one place. I believe this because there’s always somewhere new to explore. I value change and creativity.
	
	- [foodboy](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=31806787): I want to do things because reasons. I believe this because reasons. I value this and that.
	
	- [lightwarrior](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=28210287): I want to do things because reasons. I believe this because reasons. I value this and that.
	
	- [Drosera](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12989339): I want to live among Nature because I value my homeland above all else. I believe this because I was raised to believe every other flight sucks. I value my flight and good health.
	
	- [voiddancer](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=35267877): I want to do things because reasons. I believe this because I am an eldritch abomination. I value secrecy and enthusiasm.
	
	- [Carnation](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=397435): I want to explore the Southern Icefield because reasons. I believe this because reasons. I value this and that.

	### Random Ideas

	- Alto and lightwarrior could form a righteous hero duo, extinguishing the dark? Foodboy sees lightwarrior as a big sister, but he was raised by shadows (noc couple? Maelstrm and Lapilli?) and learned the importance of balance. The “siblings” have since been estranged.
	
	- At some point during Lapilli’s search for answers on her lost origins, she encountered Rivi, who’s all but forgotten her past - and seems perfectly happy about it. With the progens being dangerously close to self-awareness as pixel dragons on a game (though only Avi and maaaybe the fodder couple can really hold that claim to fame), Lapilli decided Riv was right and ceased her search.

	### Surnames

	- Surnames denote allegiance and as such tend to be shared by family members and/or clanmates, but for lack of an official census they’re informal and rarely come up. They’re mostly useful for discerning individuals with the same (first) name and in package delivery to those without clan affiliations.
	
	- **Maelstrom Swarmtail** & **Lapilli Sapport** both got their surnames from their “birth” clans. At some point after Viral Evolution’s collapse, they changed to **Virevo** for the clan that brought them together.
	
	- **Cumulonimbus Lightchaser** was the name given back in the Shifting Expanse. Altostratus has no surname - or Corcelus, from Cryptocelus + corven, if she has fondish memories of that? *Toven*, to negate the double “-us” ending??
	
	- **Solar Magistar**, based on his search for the Glow Star? Thanks to the affectionate nickname from Azurite he took up **McNubs**, which was a “joke” but not really.
	
	- **Pestilence Leechthorn** is based on [his father](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12290130)’s old name *Blackthorn* and [his mother](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12777313) fitting the description of [the Plague subspecies Leech](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDAqLKezfHmqiVWQwGy2YRLUMhYY0NtVwjkIRb_XqAU). He probably **dropped the surname** after the breed change to Mirror, and after finally becoming a Bogsneak he might get a new one, **Brewspar** (because it’s slightly more creative than “Brewster” and alludes to his fighting ability aka Coliseum level).
	
	- **Schism Sparks** just sounds cool and is sorta based on her presence “sparking” a schism in VE? I was forgetting she’s Arcane and not Fire though, whoops. After proving her loyalty to Viral Evolution she took up **Vira** and hasn’t changed since.
	
	- **Delphi Bonepick** is the name he remembers, if he had a surname at all - it’s possible he chose *Bonepick* subconsciously. After the Reaping it definitely changed - **Tangelo**? **Reapscar**?
	
	- **Frostbite** wasn’t technically a name in Flashpoint, with “Frostbite” being the catch-all for any future exaltee. In the Incessant Inferno he gained the name **Galena Inferni**, though he might’ve since **dropped the surname** since all but memory of the Inferno has been lost.
	
	- **Notturno**’s surname escapes me but the merchant job is probably relevant. Maybe it’s straight-up **Merchant**, pronounced *mer-SHAN* (sounds similar to *bonjour*) because she’s just Extra like that.
	
	- The bumblefaes probably didn’t have surnames but **Riviniana Bumble** sounds nice and sorta alludes to a “bumbling” personality? Not sure what **Gizmo**’s pre-Workshop name was (if any?) but **Bluehide** works as a surname, albeit more of a disparaging title than anything - “hide” as in skin and *hide this abomination*. Both have since taken up the surname **Golwok**, after the Golem Workshop.
	
	- **Fern Exo** is based on “exodus” and maaaybe “XOXO” in letters, since she was the first (and so far only, of three) dragon I received a hatchling letter reply from. Not that dragons would have a concept of kisses and hugs but it just sounds cool.
	
	- Foodboy needs a *first* name but **Virevo** works if he was raised by Maelstrom and Lapilli, interpreted as a family and not clan name. If the noc couple ends up relevant again though, maybe something based on night/day? **Twilight**? **Hollowbright**/**Hallobrite**?
		- Totally random but consider Vulcan “haunting” him, both because reincarnation shenanigans and also *oh my god that wasn’t an intentional parallel but I dig it.*
	
	- Lightwarrior was purchased on a whim from the artist Osiem - **Oslem**? As for first name, maybe [something meaning “sun”](https://www.behindthename.com/names/tag/sun) - Eloise? Sol? Soleil? **Soleil Oslem** has a nice ring to it but maybe rearrange the surname letters.
	
	- **Drosera Dendron** because it means [“tree” in Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendron). Sundew tree? Impossible but terrifying. Damn, that’s a cool mental image….
	
	- Voiddancer eldsomething or somethingritch. voidritch? Voidritch. been meaning to use [Kieran](https://www.behindthename.com/name/kieran) (Ciaran, Ciar pronounced “keer”) which means “black” - **Kieran Voidritch**! Nice.
	
	- **Carnation Winterbloom** because flowers and Southern Icefield. Har.
	
	- Bonus not-really-lore speedround:
		- [Fodderdad](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=22837102) and **[Delwen](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=28227209) Shaderaiser** or **Rothide** (”Roth”? but from “rot hide”). **[Azrael](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=35545223)** and **[Zara](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=35545221) Glorybringer**. Both self-given surnames.
		- **[Eavn](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=31950543) Corvynway** because of course. No relation to Cryptocelus.
		- **[Babading Babadook](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=34344324)** is a full name, what.
		- **Avi Toraptor**. Avatar of Archaeoraptor.

	More scattered lore ideas \o/

	- Despite some dramatic backstories and other serious lore potential, consider a lighthearted lore default. Drama can happen once we’ve gotten to know everyone. They’re also definitely not a big united clan - if it happens it happens, but for now? Scattered individuals with potential for interesting meetups, we’ll see how it goes frm here.
	
	- Lapilli the lorekeeper!! Use Avi’s description for an extended profile (main clan page is just a link because there’s not nearly enough space, plus self reminders and advertisements when relevant). Maelstrom can have the badges, maybe.
	
	- Solar is still “clan dad/quirky uncle.” He crosses paths with Lapilli every so often, both to help her recording efforts and so she has someone to talk to besides Maelstrom.
	
	- Pestilence’s mother fit the description of a [Leech](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDAqLKezfHmqiVWQwGy2YRLUMhYY0NtVwjkIRb_XqAU/mobilebasic), first generation. She might’ve been treated like one and passed on a few leech-y behaviors to her son, which didn’t help the spiral’s outcast status.
	
	- Notturno is a free-spirited merchant who totally doesn’t steal things to resell. She then gets stuck in a treasury position smehow and has to deal with Responsiblity.
	
	- Lightwarrior is totally not religious. She’s convinced she must smite the darkness in everyone and helped raise foodboy to keep him “pure.”
	
	- Kieran isn’t actually an eldritch disgrace but has been led to believe that and now embraces it.
	
	- The fodder four have some semblance of self-awareness but it’s whatever, they’re just here to have fun.

	- Avi: omnipotent, avatar, kinda just There but on purpose
	
	- Maelstrom & Lapilli: dangerously close to omnipotence but Nah, kinda just wanna chill. possibly helped raise foodbab, also Lapilli guides travels based on lore developments?
	
	- Altostratus: hero wannabe, might have alliance with lightwarrior, maybe dropped by Golem Workshop again for training and reconciliation. recently trained along with progens but not sure if lore relevant, fell behind on account of me giving up mire boosted
	
	- solar: just havin a good time man
	
	- Pestilence: needs breed change which may involve ~story~, maybe returned to Viral Evolution crew? chillin with solar?
	
	- Schism: wing-deep in the mire forever and always
	
	- Notturno & Drosera: nature gal pals, traveling merchant/treasurer and hardcore loyalist
	
	- Fern: also just here to have a good time, adventure edition
	
	- Riviniana & Gizmo: Workshop couple, fix & create and sometimes training
	
	- Delphi: killed foodbab and now hosts Vulcan. also invisible now apparently?
	
	- Galena: oh god get him out of here he just wants to find a new purpose in life and stay away from Delphi
	
	- lightwarrior: foodbab’s older sis, not a religious savior or anything but also totally a religious savior Fighting The Dark. maybe after Galena now trailing Delphi, potential alliance with fellow hero Alto?
	
	- unnamed skydancer bab: who even knows but she looks beautiful
	
	- Eavn, Midst, Kieran: Cryptid Bros™ who mostly suck at the mysterious cryptid thing. Eavn just likes being Edgy, Midst is kinda misunderstood loner but might legit pull some shady stuff, and Kieran has void wings but otherwise just wants a friend (was ordered near Drosera for a while, possible pals? solidarity)
	
	- Carnation: stuck in the icelands somewhere, not necessarily omnipotent but lore ends here
	
	- “foodbab” is g1 relegated to page 2, will be exalted on the 25th at latest

	[Very Serious Lore.jpg]

	> Of her first life Vulcan had two memories. First, that she was destined for glory. Second, that she had been utterly robbed of it and would stop at nothing to reclaim her throne.
	>
	> Naturally, the best way to achieve this was by possessing a newborn hatchling.

	- eh too obvious as a wrathia clone, start with Tyson?
	
	- basically vulcan has been haunting tyson his whole life, encouraging him to get stronger so even if she can’t rule an empire herself, he can - under her “guidance.” she’s made no secret of the fact this is pretty much “you do as I say and put *me* back in power,” no fake generosity, but a whole lotta “this is giving you a purpose in life, yes? yes. other dragons are not so gifted.”
	
	- to her credit this has given tyson a huge leg up as far as honing his elemental magic and general skillset goes.

	OH while I’m here, screenshot from the 1st I almost forgot to post.

	I feel like this would be good story/drabble fuel but I am Lazy™, so bullet-point summary is:

	- Alto’s [mentee](viral-evolution#Azurite) had the other stingray boss as a familiar for a while, in lore.
	
	- Alto was really jealous of this mentee for getting to level 25 first being much stronger than her.
	
	- If I had to describe Altostratus in one sentence it would be “perpetually trying really hard to prove herself.”
	
	- [Years later](https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/171986033194) she finally gets to level 25, more or less alongside progens Maelstrom and Lapilli. Still gotta work out if/how this is relevant to lore but I guess they reconciled…?
	
	- While training an exaltee - something Azurite and her mate Rook did on the regular - Alto gets herself the *other* stingray familiar.
	
	- ???
	
	- ~BOOKENDS~ OR SOMETHING

	Once upon a time there was a vengeful empress. Her kingdom, which in its glory days sprawled across the Emberglow Hearth, boasted unimaginable power. The Incessant Inferno would blaze forever… or so [Vulcan](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=16213216) thought.

	Alas, an uprising - foreign power? internal strife? best not to dwell on it - dethroned the empress and exiled her from her own land. For years thereafter, Vulcan scoured Sornieth for the most willing warriors. She promised new recruits grandeur beyond their wildest dream, if only they would join her fight to reclaim glory.

	But when at last the Incessant Inferno returned to its homeland, they found the locals doing just fine. Rather than allow the truth of her shame come to light, Vulcan plunged her crew into the Tangled Wood - and from here, she and [many other dragons](http://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/tagged/flight-reaping/chrono) never returned.

	Or so it seemed.

	On the day of Vulcan’s downfall, [a lone mirror](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=31806787) hatched. He grew up alongside [a fellow orphan](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=28210287) in reality and an irate coatl in what seemed to be his imagination. This might have made an interesting story, except it’s been done to death and the writer could not be bothered, for a full year, to flesh out an original version.

	Instead [Tyson died](ya-just-had-to-kill) unceremoniously and without fuss, on the anniversary (+2 months) of his hatching. [His murderer](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=15585543), a more interesting character, has since turned invisible and now bears the burden of Vulcan’s spirit. Something may or may not come of this but he has a cool lion cape now.

	Outfit change forthcoming but HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOU DISGUSTING SCIENTIST. You get the gift of rot!

	lore as it is now, rewrite forthcoming but I really am a stickler for archival. written on or prior to March 22, 2017.

	> Scientists are doomed to be outcasts, aren’t they? Such is the life of Pestilence, who was hatched a spiral into a clan on the brink of demise, failed to fit in upon changing his own species, and though he found a temporary home with a traveling army-in-the-making, that too dissolved.
	>
	> The story of the plague clan Viral Evolution was nearing its climax when a lone spiral, Epidemic, and her sole progeny attempted to settle down. Unfortunately, Pestilence’s mother met her demise at the claws of infuriated imperials during the Incident that marked the clan’s point of no return. With his clanmates preoccupied wringing their own claws, Pestilence turned inward. There was a certain catharsis to be found in throwing sludge at a rock and watching the subsequent erosion.
	>
	> After much practice and out-of-clan spying, Pestilence morphed himself into a mirror. The transformation was almost as painful as the lack of immediate acceptance; nonetheless his studies persisted. When he met a lookalike mirror, Apocrypha, the outcasts became fast friends. Revitalized, Pestilence began offering his services to other dragons - a new gene here, some spikes there, and maybe that wayward slime stain will give you a never-before-seen marking! Okay, it might burn through your skin and be really painful, but it’ll leave a really unique scar, right?
	>
	> Eventually Pestilence grew bored trying to pester his clanmates and other passing dragons to hear him out. Around this time, Viral Evolution’s rotting corpse had almost collapsed, so when Apocrypha announced intentions to leave, Pestilence joined him. Thus the two joined a fiery coatl, Empress Vulcan, on her quest to reestablish her traveling troupe known as the Incessant Inferno as her kingdom reborn.
	>
	> For a time, Pestilence had fun developing new toxins, each more lethal than the last, and even got the chance to experiment with substances in the Tangled Wood. However, the move was prompted by an alliance with the shadow beastclan Cryptocelus, and after a disastrous chain of events turned corven against dragon against ghost against dragon, these groups too fell apart.
	>
	> At this point, Apocrypha asked Pestilence to join him and another close friend in their return to the Scarred Wasteland. However, Pestilence had no desire to turn his life over to the Plaguebringer. Once they bid their farewells, Pestilence set his sights on the recently-discovered “bogsneak” breed. Perhaps another change is in order.

	old\* lore dump again ignore this

	> \*c. 2015!! twenty-fifteen! my god!

	Plague and Nature do not and were never meant to mix. Few can attest to this better than Drosera, once pampered by the Viridian Labyrinth’s abundance but now disgusted by the barren Scarred Wasteland. Having ventured into Plague lands as part of a Greenskeeper Gathering effort to spread Nature’s harvests, Drosera didn’t want to linger. Unfortunately, because of how far in the once-sheltered Mirror is, it’s unlikely Drosera can return without needing to be quarantined (or worse) upon reentry. Failure to avoid Nature could lead to a flight-wide epidemic.
	
	[img:oh-youre-disgusting]

	This is how the clan’s non-Plague members justify staying, at least. Drosera is doubtful - if this was the case, wouldn’t Plague-borne disease have killed all of dragonkind by now? If nothing else, Drosera remains in an attempt to introduce civiliza–structure to the apparent chaos that is this clan. Reactions to this unsolicited help range from appreciation to annoyance, but no one minds enough to cause a fuss. Besides, relationships are becoming less forced as time goes on - though Drosera would rather bathe in the Wyrmwound than admit this.

	In celebration of finally getting Gizmo fully gened after like three years, gonna try to update the Golem Workshop faes’ lore \o/ Have another dump of unedited ancient lore.

	c. May 2016
	
	### Riv

	> Once there were four striped faes who, while scavenging the bamboo forests of the Zephyr Steppes, found an egg. They had no idea how to raise a hatchling, but they took the egg in anyway, because they had nothing better to do. The egg hatched into a plainly-colored tundra, who the faes were *definitely* not prepared to raise. Somehow, the tundra managed not only to avoid a premature death, but also transformed into a striped fae herself thanks to a scientist friend. This development made everyone very happy.
	>
	> And then the four faes decided their friendships with some clan dragons were more important than Riviniana, or something like that, and left to serve Plaguebringer. To say Riv was upset would be an understatement. Since the other bumblefaes preferred not to fight, Riv threw herself into honing her windy magic.
	>
	> During this time she was trained in part by Schism, a dragon from the clan who also stayed behind, and they met two spirals who were on good terms with the bee fae quartet. The little group was also joined by an ice mirror who understood Riv’s frustration at having relatives leave. But with magic training on her mind and new friendships brewing, Riv forgot about the bumblefaes’ betrayal. (Her tundra origins may or may not have contributed to this forgetfulness. Wait, she hasn’t always been a fae?)
	>
	> Eventually the group went their separate ways, for no particular reason other than that none of them liked staying in the same place for too long. Riviniana ventured east, where she met another magically-inclined fae called Gizmo, and the duo soon became inseparable. If there’s a workshop, they’re most likely in it, testing out spells on machinery and building contraptions of their own. Rivi occasionally visits Schism, who’s still being approached by exaltees, and is more than happy to guide those dragons to the nearest workshop. She and Gizmo train, play, and build like clockwork, and they have no concept of a sleep schedule.
	>
	> [sub]I didn’t hatch this dragon, but for lore reasons she’s around since hatching.
	>
	> Picked her up as adult fodder; I dunno who hatched and/or sold her, but if you happen to be reading this, thank you :D
	>
	> [sub]\[old description] oh my. it looks as though there is a tundra among the bee faes.[/sub][/sub]
	
	---

	### Gizmo

	> Gizmo is not a robot, but don’t tell it that. There is no way an egg from the Ashfall Waste could have hatched into such a blue dragon. And if a real dragon was taken in by a grand and oh-so-noble empire only to be shunned upon revealing its true colors, it would have died young and alone. This little blue found a home in a workshop among fumes and metal and it is not dead, so *checkmate*, nature fundamentalists.
	>
	> There may or may not have been a wandering Lightning dragon involved in its upbringing, since robots aren’t good parents, but whoever that dragon was disappeared and Gizmo is extremely self-sufficient. It’s so self-sufficient, in fact, that it managed to leave its white desert of a home and tried to follow that dragon for months before losing them somewhere around the Sea of a Thousand Currents.
	>
	> None of that matters now, of course. What’s important is that Gizmo has no problem jumping from workshop to workshop all around Sornieth and eats rust for breakfast - or at least the organic equivalent of rust, aka scavenged dead stuff, but Gizmo calls its sustenance rust because it loathes nature and that sounds hardcore. The closest thing Gizmo has to an affinity for the natural world is magic. Fire (flight) may have rejected it, but fire (element) fascinates it to no end. How can something morph even the most solid stone yet succumb to something weak as a splash of water?

	> After flying around solo for a time, Gizmo met a fellow magically-inclined fae, Riviniana. It hesitated to trust her at first, especially when it learned she was named after a flower, but before long they grew inseparable. While Gizmo maintains its dislike of anything organic, it has a soft spot for flowers. The duo spends their days messing around, building, and sometimes training a stray exaltee or two. In true mechanical form, Gizmo has no concept of breaktime.
