# Elsewhere in Sornieth: Viral Evolution’s Dissolution and the (Attempted) Rise of Vulcan

## 2015 August 28 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/127809585030

	By the way, meet my Fire “representative,” [Vulcan](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=16213216)! AKA the most vengeful Coatl you will ever meet.

	(That’s an adult preview; she’ll probably have the [Blazing Plumage](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/skin/1481198) accent and a fancy cape. At the time of writing she’s three days young, but we’re just. gonna pretend she’s really old. Because I actually had a story in mind before finding her in [this fantastically fiery hatchery](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/baz/994275), and it won’t work if she’s a hatchling.)

	- Vulcan used to control a large and powerful clan - maybe not as famous as she’d like to think, but nonetheless mighty. She ruled with an iron fist, which isn’t necessarily a downfall for Fire dragons; she certainly *considers* herself a wise and benevolent empress.
	
	- A rival clan’s conquest brought it in direct conflict with Vulcan’s empire. Vulcan would say that, despite strong opposition, her empire fell and she faced either assimilation or exile. Dragons within the clan would report that, while there certainly *was* warfare involved, several of Vulcan’s “loyal subjects” defected prior to the official takeover. It is unknown whether these dragons switched alliances voluntarily or were intimidated into their betrayal - or both. Such situations are never clear-cut.
	
	- Regardless, Vulcan no longer has an empire to her name. And she is not content. Since her exile, she’s traveled Sornieth in search of new recruits who will help her fight to reclaim her rightful place on the throne. Her sole requirement is a willingness to serve, not necessarily by tooth and claw (though fighting abilities are certainly a bonus). In exchange for their loyalty, Vulcan’s new army will find a place of honor waiting for them in their future home.
	
	- Vulcan *has* successfully recruited a few dragons, though I haven’t decided who. Maybe I’ll finally put some of those dragons I want to keep but have no lore for to use….

	\[double line break]

	- As [I’ve previously implied](oh-youre-disgusting), I imagine that holidays have dragons from the celebrating flight traveling throughout Sornieth in the name of goodwill and cheer. Vulcan, masquerading as one such representative, found the main clan during Flameforger’s Festival.
	
	- The clan, now going by the name Viral Evolution, has had plenty of time to recover from [The Incident](worldbuilding-wednesday). Since then, three dragons have found a permanent home within the clan: [Pestilence](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13483458), an alchemist wannabe who happened to have encountered VE prior to The Incident but only recently settled in; [Apocrypha](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14133744), a lost youth; and [Caduceus](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14450320), a mage who arrived with Apocrypha when they were both young.
	
	- Caduceus has solidified eir role as the clan’s sole healer. This position was previously filled by [Cristofori](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11943858), though The Incident left a sour taste in his mouth. When two stray Mirror hatchlings found their way to the clan, Cristofori passed on his knowledge to both, then left. Only Caduceus clung to his teachings; Apocrypha was indifferent.
	
	- Pestilence and Apocrypha are (Cumulonimbus notwithstanding) the clan’s outcasts. No one directly shames them and they’re not disliked, but they’ve been unable to establish real *purposes* within the clan.
		- Pestilence knows how to throw together suspicious ingredients in the name of experimentation, sure, but what good is a bunch of sludge? Xe is fully aware that xyr creations rarely if ever benefit the clan, though it doesn’t (seem to) bother xem.
		- Apocrypha? Not so much. Ze just can’t seem to find a use for zirself. Magic and science doesn’t interest zir, and zir hunting/fighting skills are… lacking, at best. Apocrypha *tries* to learn from zir clanmates, but nothing sticks. At least ze doesn’t feel quite as useless when hanging out with Pestilence, but frankly some of those experiments scare zir.
		- As for Cumulonimbus, while ae will never be able to recover the level of trust aer clanmates had prior to The Incident, no one’s holding it against aer either. (Well, Cristofori did - but that’s part of why he left.) But ae cannot help but hold it against aerself and has made it difficult for anyone else to forget.
	
	- Enter Vulcan. She’s taken quite the liking to these outcasts….

	I’m very tempted to write a story about a key conversation or two between Vulcan and Apocrypha or Cumulonimbus. But for the time being, you can probably guess exactly what this fallen empress is trying to accomplish.

	I guess you could say that things are… *heating up* in the clan of Viral Evolution. B)

	~~all right I’ll see myself out~~

## 2015 December 30 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/136271279120

	You know how I’ve mentioned wanting to restart everything, which includes wiping the lair? HERE WE GO.

	In the aftermath of the Incident, the clan of Viral Evolution is fraught with tension. One would expect the clan would only grow closer after such an ordeal, but not everyone is happy with the fallout.

	The mage, Cristofori, and his close friend Reverie are resentful of how the bee Faes have been *rewarded* for killing ten Imperials, innocent dragons who were fed nothing but lies the second they volunteered for Cumulonimbus’ project. Reverie, for one, makes no secret of his desire to leave, and Cristofori rushes to train a new mage for the clan before his friend runs out of patience.

	Caduceus, the mage-in-training, is one of four dragons who never felt like they *belonged* in the clan. One is Pestilence, a scientist wannabe who was dropped off as the egg of an exaltee, and after turning xyrself from a Spiral into a Mirror, xe gave up trying to fit in. Another is Lux, a Spiral who left home much too early in a bout of excitement for Brightshine Jubilee and whose immune system refuses to let hir return. The fourth is Apocrypha, a youth who shows promise as a scribe but - to Cadceus’ frustration - is unable to claim any specific role. None of the four are intentionally alienated, but their lack of relation to the clan’s founding members is painfully apparent.

	Escalating matters, Azurite encounters Cumulonimbus - now named Altostratus - during a hunting expedition. The encounter ends with Azurite leading a reluctant Altostratus back to the clan - ae expects no forgiveness (fortunately, as not everyone is willing to afford it), but ae would like to make things up however ae can.

	A fragile silence falls over Viral Evolution, if only because no one wants to start a fuss. After all, it’s been rumored that the clan’s very founder left their previous clan after intracommunity issues forced a stressful divide that Maelstrom didn’t want to deal with. Even before the Incident, Maelstrom never presented themselves as a leader as much as someone who happened to have authority by virtue of experience. If the clan’s founder left, what would become of the rest?

	The silence is tested when Cristofori deems Caduceus’ training complete and leaves with Reverie, never to return. It seems like their leave will proceed smoothly, but Cristofori can’t help but shoot a final glare at Altostratus before flying away. The message is clear.

	Silence remains.

	Enter Vulcan. A representative for Flameforger’s Festival, she seems far too eager to linger while her immunity builds. She takes a liking to the outcasts, especially Apocrypha - and ze learns the truth first.

	A fallen leader from the Ashfall Waste, Vulcan travels Sornieth in search of recruits for her new clan. Nothing short of glory and splendor awaits those who join her! Someday they will return to her former clan, seized from her by a dastardly enemy, and victory shall be theirs forever.

	Furthermore, those who join Vulcan will be loved and honored no matter what their background - and if they feel alienated, Vulcan will handle the situation immediately. There is no room for outcasts in a growing army.

	Nothing could appeal to Apocrypha more. Once ze swears zir life to her, Vulcan attempts to recruit other members of the clan, specifically the outcasts. Caduceus rejects the offer in a heartbeat; this clan is eir home, whether ey like it or not, and ey has no desire for conquest. Pestilence shrugs it off; if xyr skills truly will come in handy there better than here, xe might seek Vulcan out on xyr own later. If xe is unable to find her, then xe knows it’s not worth it. Lux ponders the decision - and ponders and ponders and ponders. Finally, Altostratus considers, but ultimately decides aer debt does not lie with anyone outside Viral Evolution.

	Apocrypha, feeling betrayed by Caduceus’ refusal to join, makes a show of his leave, asking why anyone would want to stay in a “clan” that’s obviously a close-knit family - and no, that does not include every member. There are too many dragons who ultimately serve no purpose to the *true* members. Ze, for one, is going to serve Vulcan (who, while this occurs, could not be more proud; she makes a note to self to return to the area), and the rest of them can be devoured by the Shade if they refuse to see the truth.

	Truth? Lux is intrigued. Though wishing no ill will to the others, sie joins Vulcan as well.

	The clan divides nonetheless.

	Apocrypha’s parting words strike most true with Caduceus and Pestilence. Caduceus attempts to confide in Pestilence, but as always xe throws xyrself into the mixing of substances that should not be mixed instead of acknowledging the reality of the situation. After a sleepless day, Caduceus tells Pestilence that ey will be off to serve none other than Plaguebringer Herself, and leaves without another word.

	The news is not taken well, though the remaining clan members must admit, a majority of their lives are deeply intertwined. There was a gap between Kronos’ hatching and Pestilence’s arrival, which happened to be long enough that any subsequent dragon would be alienated without trying. While no one denies the importance of the bonds that have carried everyone this far, Caduceus’ leave *does* lead some to realize they may not wish to stay here any longer.

	Pestilence, after some consideration, decides xe really would be better off elsewhere and bids a friendly farewell to the others. Xe makes no mention of Plaguebringer, but Azurite and Rook jump to conclusions. They decide that, while their exaltee training program has been a success, they’d like to start a new chapter by serving Plaguebringer directly.

	Riptide, Azurite’s friendly rival since youth, declares that Azurite won’t be getting away from vir so easily - ve will also join Plaguebringer. Chalcedony would love to traverse new lands under Her watch - not that the clan was inadequate, but despite Viral Evolution’s nomadic nature, they were never devoted to *exploration*. Kronos, who feared the split of the dragons he loves most, is eager to tag along.

	While this saddens Maelstrom and Lapilli, they realize that their offspring would inevitably forge their own paths someday, and that day has come sooner than expected - as if they ever looked forward to it.

	During the process of farewells, the bee Faes drop by for a visit. Indil, who’d always taken quite the liking to Riptide, regrets not spending more time with vir. Sonnuk picks up on this and mentions he’ll join Plaguebringer, too, if Indil wants - and so will Vayne and Ada. Sure, they love traveling all around Sornieth, but they have to admit their home has been with Plague ever since they first met the clan.

	All but Riviniana follow suit - she, for one, did not participate in the Incident, and in fact used to be a Tundra before asking Pestilence to transform her. While she never felt alienated from the other Faes, even before she became one herself, she isn’t willing to seal her fate with Plaguebringer. She thanks the faes for everything they’ve done for her, then leaves to find Pestilence or some new adventure. No matter what, though, she promises she’ll never lose her stripes.

	Solar, seeing that the “clan” has dwindled to himself, the founding couple, Altostratus, and Schism, realizes that there’s not much point in him sticking around, either. While he’s had a wonderful time in the clan, he’d still like to get a taste of Ice territory before he gets too old to comfortably travel alone. Viral Evolution has been another landmark on his map around Sornieth - albeit an important one, and he’ll fondly remember everything that’s happened. But without further ado, he’s off to get that snack in the Southern Icefield that he’s always wanted.

	Altostratus realizes that ae no longer has a clan to pay back. With all due respects to Maelstrom and Lapilli, ae decides it’s time for aer to move on, too. The founders agree that ae has spent long enough dwelling in the past and bid aer farewell. However, the desire to put the past behind aer is not nearly as motivating a factor as guilt. Altostratus ultimately returns to the Shifting Expanse, where ae ends up helping others before they go astray.

	Thus leaves the founding couple, Maelstrom and Lapilli, and Schism. Maelstrom, seeing that the clan dispersed before they did, tells both dragons they aren’t obligated to stay with Maelstrom; they will continue wandering the Scarred Wasteland regardless. Lapilli, having accepted her clan’s split ages ago, promises she’ll stay with them no matter where they go.

	Schism, at least, will stay put. *Someone*’s got to remember the clan.

	Thus the clan of Viral Evolution branches out, never to return to its former state. After all, a stagnant virus is one that dies.

	Growth and change. That’s simply how the world works.

	when you write just over a thousand words for [the bio of one dragon](viral-evolution)
	
	#the lair cleanout. it's Happening #...within the week. still gotta get info down for the other dragons staged for exaltation #not to mention dragons who I don't want exalted to Plaguebringer for lore reasons :T #soon though. for LvP. SOON.
	#next day edit: aaannd nearly 1.1k words for Azurite's bio. this is fine.jpg #...and over 1.25k for Riptide. which is probably because I kinda fleshed out the bee fae's intro but still.


## 2016 February 13 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/139209448375

	update: it’s been nearly a month and I still have not exalted a majority of the dragons I said I would.

	but hey, [two bios](viral-evolution) down! …five more to go :’D

## 2016 February 28 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/140126057595

	Some brainstorming notes for future lore, because I always come up with this stuff when I need to get offline. >:T

	- The clan of Viral Evolution separates. Most dragons, along with the bumblefaes, end up serving Plaguebringer. Others join Vulcan on her quest to raise an army and reclaim her empire. The rest are left to wander.
	
	- Meanwhile, a new “venue” - a location that dragons happen to enjoy ransacking more than others, for one reason or another - is “discovered.” The Ghostlight Ruins happen to be the home of two mirrors who were more or less raised by a local Talonok beastclan, and they’re not happy.
	
	- At some point, \[the first Shadow dragon] realizes that fighting back on their own won’t work, especially with more and more of their Corven allies succumbing to a primal, wild instinct that others cannot understand. Desperate, they stray from the Ghostlight Ruins, determined to make life a living hell for any stragglers who approach their home.
	
	- Vulcan, meanwhile, has made an alliance with an Ice clan that led to their merging under her rule. However, she’s caught word that her old empire may not exist anymore - or if it *is* still around, she wouldn’t recognize it, nor would they recognize her as rightful leader. Though she tries not to let her subordinates know of this plot twist, they’re catching on.
	
	- Cue Trickmurk Circus. \[The second Shadow dragon] has concluded that antagonism is not the answer, but strategic alliances may be. Thus they leave to represent not only Shadow but their beastclan family, searching for a strong dragon clan who can help keep the avians alive.
	
	- And so, inevitably, stragglers from Viral Evolution and Vulcan’s army will find their paths at a crossroads with one of these shadowy tricksters. But unlike the bee faes, this duo is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals, and they boast a keen mastery of their shady magic. Time will tell if they can unite a clan that fights for the corven… or if all semblance of order will be lost to the Tangled Wood’s twisting embrace.

	\[double line break]
	
	- Plague values survival, strength, adaptability and change. Plaguebringer would *not* approve of zombies and arguably not sacrifices, because they are dead and therefore useless to the unending quest for ultimate evolution.
	
	- Shadow turns Light’s pursuit of knowledge on its head; if it can be obscured, it will be. If a few lives are lost along the way, so be it. Chaos and disorder is the true state of the wild.
	
	- Neither flight is “evil” or naturally predisposed towards pointless cruelty. Both, however, display a keen affinity for things other flights may consider taboo – disease and death, the Shade and the entropy of life.
	
	- This largely takes place around the border of the Tangled Wood and Scarred Wasteland; refer to the map of Talonok beastclans for a rough estimate.

	> We reached the Tangled Wood today. It’s brimming with mystery and intrigue for anyone brave enough to dive into the fog, and any respectable scholar would kill for the opportunity to explore it under the protection of a loyal army.
	>
	> Apocrypha promises me we have no reason to fear; Vulcan herself said so. If we feel like we’re being watched, it’s a trick of the mist. The sooner we’re comfortable with it, the better. We’re here to protect, not be protected! This will be the truest test of character we’ve ever faced.
	>
	> Then I cannot deny the truth. I am a coward.

	In which [Lux](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14562462) realizes that Shadow’s domain is not a nice place for a Light dragon, and [a warrior](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14133744) cannot offer non-battle support for beans.
