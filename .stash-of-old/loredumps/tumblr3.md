	Archaeoraptor’s Semi-Dead Dragon Blog Presents: A Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Idea (feat. [Hunger Games Simulator](http://brantsteele.net/hungergames/disclaimer.php))
	
	I’ve done this Hunger Games thing before and tried to make a story out of it, and let me tell you, *why did I not notice the Save feature sooner*.
	
	In any case, there’s no way I’m gonna try to think of a story for this (yet), but here are some short bios in case I throw away all inhibitions and do that anyway:
	
	- **Ralvus** and **Sevius** live with Cryptocelus, a corven beastclan in the Ghostlight Ruins. When attacking dragons started invading their home, they took very different approaches; Ralvus wants to establish strong alliances with new clans, whereas Sevius is determined to make the attackers’ lives a living hell.
	
	- **Apidae** likes bees far more than this silly thing called “parents.” His attention span is shorter than the red feathers he likes flying around with for no particular reason other than It Looks Funny.
	
	- **Galena** survived a battle-hardened ice clan, Flashpoint, which was dominated by an army known as the Incessant Inferno just before Flashpoint could send the young mirror off to the Icewarden. He once searched for a fellow survivor, but after a harsh disillusionment, he’s on his way back to the Inferno.
	
	- **Apocrypha** found a place to call home as one of the Inferno’s top warriors. Though loyal to his new leader Vulcan, he questions the recent move to the Ghostlight Ruins.
	
	- **Pestilence** wants only to spend his days experimenting with any material he can get his claws on. Thanks to Vulcan’s guidance, he currently specializes in poison.
	
	- **Lux** hasn’t been home since he left the Sunbeam Ruins as a hatchling in a premature attempt to represent his flight. He’s never been more uncomfortable than he is in the Tangled Wood, but his bonds to Apocrypha and Pestilence keep him motivated.
	
	- **Lumen** also has no idea what she’s doing here. Possibly friends with Lux?
	
	- **Cristofori** strives to put his gifts in magic to good use, whether as a healer or a mage on the battlefield. His devotion to this, however, is straining his on-and-off relationship (mostly off nowadays) with his mate Reverie.
	
	- **Flawed** is honestly kinda just there and I need to think of a good story for her. Probably responsible for getting Cristofori into this mess and not Reverie?
	
	- Several dragon duos once held positions in clans that have since been overtaken by the Incessant Inferno: **Aeron** and **Frostbite**, **Aeon** and **Evergreen**, **Nexus** and **Romeo**, **Neptune**, and **Mercury**.
		- Aeon and Frostbite led Flashpoint. Supposedly they’ve pledged their loyalties to Vulcan in exchange for being allowed to live, but they’ve instilled within their adoptive son **Hydra** a thirst for vengeance (or at least they’ve tried).
	
	- **Ira**, **Delphi**, **Rex**, **Terry**, and **Hookbill** are all terrible freeloaders who have approximately 0 lore but I keep them around because they look nice. Or at least I did, until I got this idea. >:3c
	
	…Man, I am *not* looking forward to seeing what happens to some of these guys, especially the plague mirror duo because they’re level 25 and two of my oldest dragons. D: Depending on how this goes I might not actually exalt them, at least until I can train up a couple replacements, but I’m throwing them in here for lore reasons.
	
	WHY they’re all involved in this nonsense in the first place is beyond me. ~Mysterious shadow games~ I guess…?
	
	Anyhow! I’m just gonna fast-forward to the end, jot down notable stuff, and then brainstorm how the heck this all plays out day-by-day. *Time for the ultimate lair purge.*

## 2016 August 15 https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/148992523784

	Have you ever wanted to read my brainstorming process for stringing together randomly-generated events?

	Screw it, I’m gonna note *literally everything* because I love to record useless information.

	**The Bloodbath**

	- Lumen, Flawed, Romeo, Terry, Ira, Apocrypha, Nexus, Cristofori, and Aeon run away from the Cornucopia. Scaredy-lizards. >:T
	
	- Evergreen and Apidae run into the Cornucopia and… hide. A'ight.
	
	- Delphi grabs a shovel. drovel (dragon shovel)
	
	- Lux runs away with some lighter and a rope. *Light*er. Ba dum tss.
	R
	- Ralvus, Hydra, and Mercury work together to get as many supplies as possible. An alliance is born!
	
	- Frostbite takes a handful of throwing knives. Because claws just aren’t enough.
	
	- Pestilence and Aeron fight for a bag. Aeron gives up and retreats. Must’ve been a bag of chemicals.
	
	- Sevius finds a bow, some arrows, and a quiver. Quadrupeds can use archery, I guess!
	
	- Rex grabs a shield lying on the Cornucopia. Obligatory guardian joke.
	
	- Neptune grabs a sword. Not a trident…? D:
	
	- **Galena strangles Hookbill after engaging in a fist fight.** Man, kinda wish the first death had been a dragon with more than 0 lore, but there you have it…!

	**Day 1**

	- Pestilence questions his sanity. Working with dragon drugs in a hell fight will do that to you.
	
	- Flawed sprains her ankle while running away from Lumen. Small skydancer chases giant imperial, more at 11!
	
	- Frostbite collects fruit from a tree. Where’s your partner…?
	
	- Rex sprains her ankle while running away from Aeon. Not sure of the size difference here but fine.
	
	- Neptune diverts Sevius’s attention and runs away. Never mind the archery thing, I guess?
	
	- Hydra discovers a river. Now let’s see if you share….
	
	- Evergreen tends to Apidae’s wounds. Aw, even a fallen leader(?) can’t help but take pity on this feathery flighty fellow.
	
	- Lux makes a slingshot. That’s it, slingshot things that are burning.
	
	- Ira is pricked by thorns while picking berries. Truly the most graceful skydancer.
	
	- Terry discovers a cave. Those totally exist in the middle of a dark woodland and/or ancient ruins, sure.
	
	- Galena runs away from Cristofori. Hrmm.
	
	- Aeron, Delphi, Nexus, and Ralvus raid Mercury’s camp while he is hunting. …Hold on, Ralvus and Mercury? *Betrayal.*
	
	- Apocrypha scares Romeo off. Nice to know the warrior is remembering the whole soldier thing instead of running away this time. >:V

	**Night 1**

	- Frostbite questions her sanity. You’ve been lonely, haven’t you…
	
	- Neptune passes out from exhaustion. Running with sharp objects is exhausting, especially on those stubby little feet.
	
	- Ira and Pestilence talk about the tributes still alive. Honestly, I’d sorta envisioned Ira as some sort of chessmaster considering she’s the only shadow dragon here; either they’re reminiscing about the good ol’ days when everyone wasn’t trying to kill each other for no apparent reason, or “hey dude are these berries useful for soul-crushing poison or not jw.” Maybe both?
	
	- Evergreen lets Hydra into her shelter. oh my god stop taking pity on the youth and *fight*
	
	- Mercury loses sight of where he is. Cue grayscale stock photo manipulation with faded overlays of this icy coatl’s face.
	
	- Aeron convinces Rex to snuggle with him. THIS IS NOT HOW A COLD-BLOODED LEADER ACTS AND I AM ASHAMED
	
	- Galena receives clean water from an unknown sponsor. Thanks, Hydra…?
	
	- Flawed stays awake all night. Haunted by that terrible random name generator, probably. (You’re not alone.)
	
	- Aeon sets up camp for the night. None of the couples are staying together, this is incredible.
	
	- Ralvus sees a fire, but stays hidden. Yyyeaaahhhhh I guess that whole “ally with the entire Incessant Inferno” thing didn’t really work out, did it? Especially since you kicked off The Bloodbath by allying with a couple dragons who’d presumably have a grudge against the leader.
	
	- Cristofori and Sevius sleep in shifts. A trusting dragon Sevius is, yes.
	
	- **Delphi kills Lux with his own weapon.** LUX NO…. The mirror used a flaming slingshot to strike down the light spiral overnight this is terrible.
	
	- Apidae tries to sing himself to sleep. you-tried.jpg
	
	- Romeo cooks her food before putting her fire out. Is this what Ralvus is seeing…?
	
	- Terry fends Nexus, Lumen, and Apocrypha away from her fire. Wise decision.

	**Recap**

	Galena strangled Hookbill after a “fistfight,” Delphi killed Lux with his(? presumably Lux’s) own weapon, and there were a couple alliances that didn’t really work out. The cruel leaders of Flashpoint are being sentimental saps and everyone needs couples therapy.

## 2016 August 15 https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/148993340304

	For all intents and purposes I could (and probably should) do this all in one post, but it’s my blog and I do what I want. >:V
	
	**Day 2**

	- **Romeo falls into a pit and dies.** Wherefore art thou indeed.
	
	- Galena and Cristofori hunt for other tributes. After running away on Day 1, huh? These two don’t have direct history, but Cristofori was clanmates with the dragon Galena once searched for. Some interesting potential here, hrm.
	
	- **Hydra sets Apocrypha on fire with a molotov.** JESUS
		- I didn’t realize this was a death until the Fallen Tributes round, whoops. Dragons aren’t immune to fire, I guess. In any case, what a way to go. You’ll be missed, dark warrior mirror man. D: One “dream” dragon destroyed by another…
	
	- Aeon injures himself. … :(
	
	- Frostbite receives medical supplies from an unknown sponsor. “Hey, deliver this to Frostbite. Yes, the one who looks like she’s frostbitten 24/7. The random name generator is fun!”
	
	- Pestilence receives a hatchet from an unknown sponsor. Aw, how are you supposed to mix toxins with that?
	
	- Rex collects fruit from a tree. The mental image of a big lumbering guardian climbing up a tree is a beautiful thing.
	
	- Delphi begs for Evergreen to kill him. She refuses, keeping Delphi alive. What did I just say about taking pity on your enemies! D:<
	
	- Ralvus chases Sevius. Well, if these two were supposed to have a sibling-like relationship, I guess this is where the rivalry part comes in.
	
	- Neptune and Mercury think about home. Nonsense, I haven’t fleshed out your lore enough for you two to *have* a home.
	
	- Ira discovers a river. Hydra and now Ira, must be a “ai-ra” curse/blessing.
	
	- Lumen collects fruit from a tree. Only slightly more graceful than a guardian except double skydancer wings.
	
	- Nexus practices his archery. Spirals should just shoot themselves across the battlefield, all things considered.
	
	- Apidae stalks Terry. *Buzz buzz,* motherfucker.
	
	- Flawed steals from Aeron when he isn’t looking. You’ve really let yourself go since your clan leader days, buddy.

	**Night 2**

	- Terry sets up camp for the night. Now if only you had some actual character so I could comment on this instead of, y’know, your lack of character.
	
	- Mercury fends Neptune, Pestilence, and Frostbite away from his fire. Pestilence, your best friend just got immolated. What are you doing.
	
	- Aeron, Nexus, Apidae, Ira, and Hydra sleep in shifts. Interesting matchup! Hydra and Ira get paired up again, and Aeron gets some quality time with his murderous son.
	
	- **Cristofori attempts to climb a tree, but falls on Rex, killing them both.** LOSERS, BOTH OF YOU. Rex is ehh, but Cristofori, really? You’re a coatl. Coatls can’t climb.
	
	- Delphi begs for Lumen to kill him. She refuses, keeping Delphi alive. Dude, this is the second time now you’ve begged for death.
	
	- Evergreen receives medical supplies from an unknown sponsor. Must’ve been those toothpaste companies.
	
	- Ralvus passes out from exhaustion. It’s been quite a couple days, hasn’t it.
	
	- Galena defeats Flawed in a fight, but spares her life. Seeing as Flawed might be related to Cristofori and Reverie somehow? Hrmmmm.
	
	- **Sevius falls into a frozen lake and drowns.** Ouch.

	**Recap**

	Romeo, Apocrypha, Cristofori, Rex, and Sevius are dead. Most of these deaths are anticlimactic as all heck, except for Apocrypha because Hydra set him on fire somehow. What a disaster. Hydra and Ira seem to be connected somehow, and there are some interesting things happening with Cristofori, Galena, and Flawed. Also, Delphi seems to be having a minor breakdown.

## 2016 August 15 https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/148993889014

	Day three and 7/24 dragons are dead. That’s over a third of the lizards and that’s terrible.

	**Day 3**

	- Flawed questions her sanity. I don’t even know what to say about these anym–
	
	- **Apidae, Pestilence, and Galena unsuccessfully ambush Nexus, Terry, and Evergreen, who kill them instead.** HOLY PLAGUEMOTHER WHAT IS THIS. Okay, quick recap:
		- Evergreen and Apidae were the only two to hide in the Cornucopia. That day, she tended to his wounds.
		- Apidae stalked Terry on day 2. Has he been planning this?
		- Last night, Apidae and Nexus were two of several dragons who slept in shifts. Guess that didn’t really work out.
		- Pestilence hasn’t interacted with any of these dragons before, not in pre-established lore or this challenge. If I really squint I could probably connect a few dots, though, especially given… whatever Galena was up to. He hasn’t interacted with any of these dragons before, either.
		- The first night had Terry scaring Nexus away from her fire. She’s been surprisingly prepared thus far.
		- FINALLY Evergreen kills someone! Someone she healed earlier in the competition, even!!
	
	- Frostbite tries to spear fish with a trident. Honestly, where’d you get that from.
	
	- **Lumen severely slices Hydra with a sword.** >“severely slices” …I’m assuming this means he’s dead. No nonsense emperor raising here, folks.
	
	- **Aeon sets Aeron on fire with a molotov.** “There can only be ONE dragon with the name AEON and the letter R can’t save you!”
	
	- Ira, Ralvus, Neptune, Mercury, and Delphi hunt for other tributes. That’s it, Delphi, getcha head in the game.

	**Night 3**

	- Terry cries herself to sleep. Dragons can cry?
	
	- Nexus receives clean water from an unknown sponsor. The toothpaste companies sponsoring Evergreen decided to pass on the gift.
	
	- Ralvus tends to his wounds. That tribute-hunt wasn’t even successful, though. >:T
	
	- Ira and Neptune huddle for warmth. Now here’s a new alliance, maybe!
	
	- Evergreen, Delphi, Lumen, and Frostbite tell each other ghost stories to lighten the mood. *Lighten* hahaha *Lux is dead I’m dying inside.*
	
	- Aeon, Mercury, and Flawed sleep in shifts. The partnerships continue to not be a thing.

	**Recap**

	Looking back on it, Apidae’s gotten around a *lot* for a weird bee. Alas, he and two other dragons with Actual Lore, Pestilence and Galena were slaughtered when their attack backfired. Meanwhile, Hydra got “severely sliced,” and Aeron got set on fire. What a day.

## 2016 August 15 https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/148994869914

	If I’m counting correctly, half the competitors are dead, including basically everyone with actual fleshed-out lore. Rip in rest.

	With that in mind, I don’t have a lot to say for the rest of this, so here goes:

	**Day 4**

	- Evergreen and Nexus work together for the day. Hate for a failed ambush group brings them together.
	
	- Ralvus receives fresh food from an unknown sponsor. Oh hey, remember the corven?
	
	- Frostbite attacks Lumen, but she manages to escape. Light dragons can’t tell good ghost stories, pass it on.
	
	- **Delphi, Aeon, and Neptune successfully ambush and kill Terry, Ira, and Flawed.** WELL THEN.
	
	- **Mercury dies from hunger.** An anticlimactic end for a dragon who lost his way long ago.

	**Night 4**

	- **Neptune tracks down and kills Aeon.** “You said there can only be one dragon with a suspiciously similar name, but you failed to realize there can only be one water coatl here, too!”
	
	- Evergreen destroys Delphi’s supplies while he is asleep. Finally, doing that hardcore leader thing…!
	
	- Ralvus and Nexus sleep in shifts. These two possibly had connections but I’m too lazy to search the logs. >:T
	
	- Lumen climbs a tree to rest. Well hey, that tree-climbing thing for the sake of berry picking paid off! Still, though. Dragons in trees.
	
	- **Frostbite falls into a frozen lake and drowns.** The irony of this is killing me. And so the icy reign of the Flashpoint clan ends once and for all… in a frozen lake! Incredible, absolutely incredible.

	**The Feast**

	- **Nexus catches Neptune off guard and kills him.** “You keep killing each other over silly petty reasons like names and eye colors, but you fail to realize that I share a name with a phone company!” Proof that cell phones are destroying our youth.
	
	- **Delphi tracks down and kills Lumen.** Again, I think there were Connections here somehow, buuut I’ll look for that later maybe.
	
	- Ralvus and Evergreen decide not to go to the Feast. Smart.

	**Day 5**

	- Evergreen and Ralvus try to sleep through the entire day. You’ve come so far I *suppose* you deserve to nap…
	
	- Delphi diverts Nexus’s attention and runs away. Is my icon a cold-hearted killer? Geez, maybe I should’ve made him and Romeo the leaders of Flashpoint….

	**Night 5**

	- Ralvus and Delphi sleep in shifts. Must be awfully long shifts at this point.
	
	- **Evergreen kills Nexus while he is sleeping.** Remember, kids, brushing your teeth is more important than using your cell phone! …I don’t even know where I was going with these silly product placement jokes, but I’m maybe possibly regretting the thing where I egg Evergreen on. Ah well. >:C

	**Day 6**

	- Delphi receives clean water from an unknown sponsor. The water coatls are dead, the river-discoverers are dead, toothpaste mcfeathers is still around but *who is the sponsor.*
	
	- **Ralvus dies from an infection.** If that’s not anti-climactic I don’t know what i–
	
	- **Evergreen accidentaly detonates a land mine while trying to arm it.** OH GODDAMMIT

	…And there you have it.

	Once upon a time, someone in the FR tag was asking for a Plague nest. Despite being a five-egg nest, the exact color combination being sought was nowhere to be found. As thanks/compensation, I got to keep the hatchlings. Upon adulthood, all but one was exalted, because at the time Delphi was one of twelve dragons with his color combination (and one of *five* unexalted). Also, he matched the heartred croaker familiar I threw on as a placeholder while he grew up.

	Little did I know that he would go on to have the most kills of Flight Reaping, even though he won because the other two had mishaps in the health and explosion department.

	Also, here’s a fun fact: when I hatched his nest, I gave all the kids names that began with *D*, because alliteration is fun.

	Even though one of the parents is exalted now, apparently the parents’ owner (or whoever the other hatchlings went off to) decided to keep up that trend, and I think that’s really cool.
