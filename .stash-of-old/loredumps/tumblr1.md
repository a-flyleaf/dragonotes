# Viral Evolution: Origins to The Emperor Incident

## 2015 May 20 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/119467748780

	Right, should probably start using this blog for its original purpose: keeping track of lore. Here goes nothin’.

	#this took an hour wow

	- Maelstrom’s former pack splits after intracommunity drama. Sick of having such a busy social life, Maelstrom decides to live alone.
	
	- Maelstrom is not as self-sufficient as hoped. Lapilli comes along and helps out, intending to leave when everything’s all set but there’s always *something* to do.
	
	- Cumulonimbus, a wandering hero wannabe from the Shifting Expanse, assumes that the duo is forming a clan and decides to help out. The Skydancer cannot be convinced that there’s *not* a clan forming – and ironically, the presence of a third unrelated dragon makes the group into a clan of sorts.
	
	- Azurite is left behind by a former pack and is taken under the trio’s wings. The hatchling decides to serve the clan as best as possible from here on out.
	
	- Solar arrives, somehow. Azurite playfully dubs the Coatl “Weenie McNubs” and the nickname sticks.
	
	- Maelstrom has a brief crisis about being the leader of a clan and a future parent, having settled here to *escape* a thriving social life, not create one. Doubts still resurface from time to time, but this particular conflict ended with Maelstrom deciding that everything’s worth it.
		- Maelstrom starts taking breaks from the group on occasion, just to be alone for a few days. This caused some worry early on but at this point it’s a regular thing and no one really minds. Maelstrom never has been and never will be a socialite.
	
	- Chalcedony and Riptide hatch. Riptide and Azurite soon form a rivalry, though Chalcedony is put off by the competitive atmosphere they and Cumulonimbus form.
	
	- Timeskip; I’m not really sure how time progression works here but Azurite, Chalcedony, and Riptide are young adults by the time Obsidian shows up.
		- Azurite trains under Cumulonimbus for a while but ends up surpassing the Skydancer. Cumulonimbus isn’t thrilled by this and their relationship becomes strained for a time.
		- Chalcedony, adventurous as ever, learns more and more about the territory. Riptide, who simply can’t put up a fight against Azurite anymore due to physical differences, delights in terrorizing the wildlife when the sisters explore together.
	
	- Obsidian arrives with news of Plaguebringer’s glory, among many other stories. Maelstrom is wary of the newcomer but no one else seems to mind.
	
	- Obsidian explains the concept of exalting and convinces Azurite to train up so they can serve Plaguebringer together. Solar gets in on this, partially at Maelstrom’s command and partly Just Because. The trio end up becoming three of the clan’s strongest fighters. To the rest of the clan’s relief, the Mirrors no longer want to leave.
		- I have absolutely no idea how exalting works in-world; I joke about it being some kind of sacrifice, but none of these dragons are *that* cruel and apparently exalting as death is frowned upon? (Apparently exalting is controversial as-is, no need to imply that exalted dragons die.)
		- That said, I’m trying to come up with something a little more creative than death. Right now I’m entertaining the idea of some kind of warrior training service – dragons seeking a higher purpose in life can train under certain clans, honing many skills but fighting chiefly among them. When the clan has nothing more to offer, the dragon leaves to further their quest of serving one of the gods.
		Dragons can go through many clans before they feel they’re fit enough to serve (which can explain the buying/selling mechanic), and they don’t necessarily serve the god whose flight they grew up in. On occasion they’ll actually settle down in a clan – or they may head out just as quickly as they arrived, never to be seen by that clan again.
		Who knows what happens to the dragons once they reach their gods, *if* they ever do. The clans who live closer to the gods might have more information on this, but for this humble little group near the edges of the Wandering Contagion, who knows. They’ve got to take Obsidian’s word - they’re probably not helping young hopefuls approach death - and not everyone is happy about it.
	
	- More timeskip shenanigans. Kronos hatches and soon proves to be a beautiful cinnamon roll too good for this world, too pure. An early if not the first venture into the Training Fields yielded a mouse - as a pet. The tiny Mirror dragon, one of the fiercest species and the offspring of the clan’s best fighters to boot, befriends a mouse. Despite initial worries, Azurite and Obsidian soon come to terms with their progeny’s peaceful nature.
		- Chalcedony is *thrilled*. Finally, another dragon in this clan who isn’t fixated on fighting! Kronos frequently joins Chalcedony and Riptide on their gathering expeditions.
	
	- At some point and at varying times, Swiftrunner, Dimitri, and Cristofori stop by, all hoping to serve Plaguebringer, all finding a better life with the rest of the clan. I haven’t the slightest idea what any of their personalities are, but Solar’s happy to have another stubbyleg around.
		- At the time of writing, Cumulonimbus and Cristofori are a Thing now, because it looks like they’re gonna make some really pretty dragons. This may or may not be explained in-world because if they *do* end up breeding regularly there is no way I’m explaining all those kids.
	
	- I may or may not explain the thing with the (currently unnamed) Spiral, Blackthorn, and my own quest for the Most Hardcore Mirror - humans don’t exist in this world and by extension neither do I. (Or if I am supposed to be an actual person wandering around with all these giant dragons, I’ve written myself out of the lore because I’d probably die in a day.) For the time being, Dimitri’s on vacation and that’s all I got.

	I’m not gonna be able to avoid using pronouns for much longer, huh. Why do dragons even need to be male or female. :T

## 2015 May 21 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/119489020825

	That’s it, I’m completely torn between exalting being some kind of honorable ritual versus some kind of sick sacrifice, people get super creative with both versions and I love all of them.
	
	Just like different people have different ideas about exalting, maybe the dragons do too? It’s not like anyone can know for certain, at least not those who live far from their respective deities (like my humble little clan). I mean, this is presumably taking place on a whole *planet*, it’s no wonder the stories would change from place to place. The only consistent ting is what canon states: exalted dragons serve the gods. That’s it. Everything else is fair game.

	me when I joined: hell yeah I’m gonna raise a zombie army it’s gonna be hardcore and evil and awesome
	
	me now: okay see but my dragons are actually Giant Nerds and they wouldn’t really be up for some sick sacrificial ritual and daily life in the clan is more of a sitcom than an action-packed drama how did this happen

## 2015 May 22 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/119601941625

	Some random thoughts on Mirrors and Plague Faes. This was originally going to be a few headcanons on the different breeds but I make this up as I go along and one train of thought leads to another. I’ll get around to the others someday….

	- Mirror dragons are the most feral species. The unforgiving nature of the Abiding Boneyard, which is little more than an expanse of wasteland, has prevented the formation of anything resembling a society or culture. Even in more prosperous lands, their packs are devoid of structure. Why would they need a hierarchy anyway? All that does is breed drama (as Maelstrom found out firsthand). As long as everyone is providing to the pack’s well-being somehow, whether it be through fending off foes and/or contributing to hunts, no one cares about social standing.
		- Lone Mirrors, as stated in the encyclopedia, are an anomaly. But Maelstrom had to go solo somehow, and what better way than coming from a turbulent pack?
		Someone tried to establish ranking system. It started out innocent enough, being little more than a way of grouping together the best hunters and the best fighters, but this naturally led to inter-pack rivalry. Tensions mounted, both among the competitive dragons who wanted to outrank their peers and from dragons who left the pack in a bout of disgust. Then someone (probably the one who came up with the ranking idea in the first place) got the idea of declaring themself leader, and then all hell broke loose.
		Maelstrom, who had tried to stay out of the matter altogether, decided this was the last straw, left, and never looked back.
		- This is my excuse for the clan’s total lack of structure now: Maelstrom, the closest thing the group has to a leader (and even then it’s more Lapilli’s role), has no idea how to organize a community and doesn’t have a huge desire to in the first place. This reluctance may escalate into flat-out discouragement depending on how the group develops; not everyone is used to such a “survival first, friends later” lifestyle, nor is everyone happy to live in such a way.
			- Thank goodness for familial bonds, since that’s the only real thing keeping this mishmash of a group together at the moment. I’ll get back to this….

	- Faes cannot compete with other species for food, at least not directly, due to their size. However, they have their ways of getting more than their fair share of insects. It is not uncommon for Plague Fae colonies to attack unsuspecting travelers and then flee, leaving the impression that they’ve done no real harm - but in a matter of hours, the victim has been consumed by illness from inside out. Before long the corpse has attracted swarms of hungry insects, which the Fae colony feasts upon, and the corpse is left behind for other predators.
		- Faes are insectivores. They go through this big process and don’t eat a single bite of meat. However, if time allows and there are no hungry scavengers around, they make use of the body in other ways - bones make excellent supporting structures when a colony’s home is failing, and bone carving is a favorite pastime.
		- Plague Fae colonies are usually scattered along the outermost edges of the Wandering Contagion. Most Plague predators can’t be bothered to come this far, especially not when the colonies are so well-hidden, and dragons from rival flights are ignorant of the Fae’s tactics.
		- The Plague Faes who know disease inside-out make both [the best mages](http://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/119560313575) and the best killers. Most do not share their healing abilities with those outside the colony, however. Not that Plague dragons get sick often anyway, having developed a natural immunity to all kinds of disease; Faes who hone their abilities for healing are an anomaly.
		- A catastrophic accident in Lapilli’s former colony forced survivors to flee and disperse, hence why Lapilli was alone when meeting Maelstrom.

	### Oh, You’re Disgusting.
	
	Civilization has foresaken me.
	
	#in other news I impulse bought this dragon today #and I ended up thinking of a few Nature headcanons along with this unfortunate soul's character #and this. sorta just. happened. #edit: let's pretend I didn't forget to draw the goggles
	
	The Viridian Labyrinth is a *marvelous*  place. Marvelous! We not only survive but *thrive*, surrounded by lush wildlife and Gladekeeper’s greatest splendors. Life is a breeze - moreso than it is on the Windswept Plateau, I dare say. Not that I would know, I’ve never been there. But supposedly there are tornadoes every other day, which is a horrific way to live. In the Labyrinth, we fear no such disasters. Nor must we fear for our daily survival, not with such abundance.

	And here I thought I was leaving to give the less fortunate a taste of paradise. Now’s not the time for silly bias, they said! Now’s the Greenskeeper Gathering, our land is more bountiful than ever, and what better time to offer gifts to our brethren in the name of generosity? Never mind that *they* should be the ones rewarding *us*. It’s only fair, after all, seeing as we have luxuries they can only dream of.

	It will be *easy*, they said. Here, you can even take one of those guardian bears with you, all you have to do is find a clan and throw a few Bladed Flatleaves their way. (Not that they have any use for our currency whatsoever. They’ll be using those leaves as trinkets. Trinkets! Playthings that they can throw about their lairs and look at whenever the mood strikes!) And like a fool I went for it, eager to share my flight’s glory.

	I should have turned back as soon as I realized my directions led straight into Plague lands.

	Some *honor*, conferring with our greatest rival! These lands are sicker than I ever imagined. Barren! Empty! Dragons running amok! Devoid of any semblance of life or structure. I fear that, if not for my green eyes and the holiday, I long ago would have perished in these lawless lands – as it is, a condescending stranger offered me these goggles when they saw my eyes burning from the putrid air.

	At last I stumbled upon some semblance of a clan, and I offered the leader - a Fae of all species, poor puny thing - the leaves. These precious, precious flatleaves were quickly dispersed throughout the clan - some of the youth have made a contest out of tearing them apart. I almost take pity on them. If only they knew better… although I will certainly not be teaching them if I can help it!

	Alas, I’ve been tainted by these lands. True to their name, Plague dragons are surrounded by illness, and they only survive thanks to some natural immunity. I learned this from a few non-Plague dragons who nearly jumped on me when I tried to leave, savage creatures. How terrible would it be for me to return to the Viridian Labyrinth reeking of disease, a walking catalyst of epidemic. It seems I have no choice but to stay until my immune system has built up some resistance proper, and only then I can return without needing to be quarantined upon reentry.

	This is what they tell me, at least. There is a worrying amount of non-Plague dragons in this clan and I fear they’ve been infected with some compulsion to stay. Lest I succumb to this, I’ve decided to record my distress on this sorry excuse for a tree. It pains me to use such an inferior material, not to mention how dull my claws are from such feverish scraping - but at least it seems these dragons are unfamiliar with the art of writing. No one but I will ever know my true misery, and I will revisit this daily to ensure I am never enthralled by their friendly demeanor or amusing activities.

	I never dreamed I would be mourning my ability to breathe without a repulsive taste flooding my nostrils. I have never been immersed in such exorbitant filth.

	Now if you’ll excuse me, the youth are attempting to kill my bear. “Play-hunting” their parents say. As if life is one big game and not a complex web of disaster leading up to and including my *splendid* imprisonment here.

	Gladekeeper give me strength.

	[So this happened earlier today](here-there-be-dragons) and for all I can say Flight Rising has a *weird* layout.
	
	I may or may not mess around with more coding stuff to make a tumblr theme based on FR? Or maybe a character page of sorts? In any case this post is definitely not an attempt to show off because that took *way* longer to figure out than it should have, nope.
	
	#sarcasm in the last sentence - #(this is totally showing off shhh) #and when I say /weird/ layout I mean apparently there are background images where divs should be? #among other general web design weirdness that I forget

## 2015 May 31 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/120380925640

	Until I get around to writing up some Proper Bios (cue laugh track), some lore notes on the [bee Faes](https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/120361907990/).

	#last night I finished plotting this really long story that I've had going for a couple years #and here I am writing about dragons #dragons who were supposed to be little more than a joke and maybe a second Coliseum team #ah well this is what happens when I grind for too long

	- None of these dragons are technically members of the clan. They do, however, live in the area, and interactions between the groups range from friendly meetings to “wait I didn’t realize you were a friend because I meant to make you fall into a ditch WHOOPS.”
	
	- For clarity’s sake: “the clan” refers to the main group of dragons led by Lapilli and Maelstrom, whereas the bee Faes will be referred to as a colony. I imagine actual Fae colonies are *huge* but I don’t actually intend to fill my lair with striped Faes (tempting as it is…), but it’s easier to say “the colony” than “these little annoying pricks who won’t leave the territory.”
	
	- It’s all [Sonnuk](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13339894) and [Indil](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13316776)’s fault. For whatever reason, these two don’t live in their birth colonies and they have no desire to return. While not biologically related, they consider each other siblings; despite lack of supervision for most of their youth, they managed to reach adulthood relatively unscathed, if only because of this bond.
	
	- That said, leave two mischievous Faes alone long enough and there’s bound to be trouble. This is especially the case with these two; their only “rule” in life is “have fun and don’t die.” And if having fun involves stealing from and sabotaging local clans’ hunting expeditions? Eh, so be it. The clan’s reactions make it all worth it. At least they’re not annoying enough to warrant targets on their backs, right?
	
	- Er, not quite. They’ve encountered [Chalcedony](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280263), [Riptide](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280264), and [Kronos](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13063260) on several of the trio’s outings. At first the Fae duo went undetected, with the dug up roots and missing prey being excused as faults of memory, but with every success the Faes got more and more daring. And then they got caught red-handed.
	
	- Riptide and even Chalcedony were hostile. Stealing food is one thing - maybe they were going hungry, poor things - but setting traps? Dripping amber on their heads? Scaring off prey? No, these two are just pests. What’s your *deal*? If Kronos hadn’t been present, this encounter may have ended in bloodshed, but even the diplomat left with a warning - “Please. If you know what’s good for you, stay out of trouble.”
	
	- Sonnuk, not wanting to get more involved with the clan than necessary, wanted to leave immediately. Indil, however, was curious. Was that a Fae among Mirrors? Despite Sonnuk’s protests, Indil began spying on the trio - not causing any trouble, just watching, wondering how this dynamic could possibly work.
	
	- It didn’t take long for Riptide to realize they were being watched. Not wanting to pick a fight with Kronos around, Riptide managed to meet with Indil alone, intending to find out exactly what the intruder wanted and what it would take for Indil to leave.
	
	- To Riptide’s surprise, Indil was more than happy to offer this information and then some. Then Sonnuk showed up, enraged by Indil’s apparent betrayal, then the ruckus attracted Kronos and Chalcedony, and long story short the Faes ended up taking a tour of the clan. No one but Indil was really happy about this.
	
	- Several negotiations and drawn-out discussions later, the groups came to an agreement: the Fae duo could stick around without fear of being driven out as long as they stopped causing unnecessary ruckus. This has worked out for the *most* part, but see the first point about how meetings go.
	
	- Sonnuk has started to thoroughly enjoy this new life. Sure, the clan knows the duo exists, but neither of them have to worry about being killed for existing in the area. Besides, Indil’s become good friends (rivals? Sonnuk can’t really tell) with Riptide now, and while Indil doesn’t actually want to join the clan it’s some extra incentive to stick around.
	
	- Sonnuk and Indil’s partnership became a small colony with the introduction of [Vayne](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13503730) and [Ada](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13187547). Vayne is around Sonnuk and Indil’s age and is here to stay, and while I’m not sure how incorporate Ada into the lore just yet I don’t intend to get rid of this one either.
	
	- There’s also [this little bee](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13616666) who I had for a whole thirty minutes maybe, she probably won’t be part of my lore unless there’s some clan interaction (coughs loudly I am more than willing to roleplay with any of my dragons) but hey she gets a shout-out anyway.
	
	- Oh yes, and about the *bee* thing? Lore-wise, it’s a coincidence that all the Faes have stripes. Except Ada, who is an outlier adn should not have been counted but the markings are close enough. And since this all is kinda related to the whole “only Faes can defeat Emperor dragons” joke PLUS the fact I’ve recently exalted/will be exalting a couple of Imperials (Swiftrunner and Reanna)? Hmm. Maybe not an Emperor since apparently only the deities can defeat those zombie abominations, but if I can find some way to shoehorn Faes defeating Imperial dragons into my lore, I will.

## 2015 June 30 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/122875750725

	Oh yeah, forgot to mention, this happened yesterday:
		https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cdd54f3c165c5f542a52b9772a4838b/tumblr_inline_nqrvsxe5RI1tvl5os_250.png

	It’s official, lore-wise I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing. I’m tempted to keep the main clan + bee faes small and have everyone else as entirely separate characters (be free at last, Drosera). Because I have no way to seamlessly incorporate all of my “keepers” into the lore I’ve established, but I’m not getting rid of the misfits any time soon. :T

	For the time being, let’s just say my clan lore is an even bigger work in progress than usual, and I may or may not redo a good amount of it soon.

## 2015 July 10 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/123733002335

	At long last, I’ve figured out some clan lore proper! As in there’s a bit of a story going on, not to mention I’ve *finally* sorted my dragons into coherent groups.

	Yes, group*s*. Because I can’t shoehorn everyone into one clan. 

	- main clan (still needs a name): A ragtag family of sorts, with mercenary training on the side. Mostly consists of Plague Mirrors, though outsiders with immune systems strong enough to prevent constant illness are included. Lacks an official hierarchy, though each dragon has a role they’ve carved out for themselves.
		- Having outgrown their original home in the Wandering Contagion, which was never really meant for more than one dragon anyway, they’ve *finally* moved to the Abiding Boneyard. Currently nomadic, traveling wherever resources are available, though few are used to such frequent moves and they’d all like to settle down as soon as possible.
	- representatives: Currently includes [Drosera](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12989339) and [a Light Spiral I haven’t named yet](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14562462), both of whom showed up for a while to spread some holiday cheer. Drosera failed to account for just how disease-ridden these lands were and had to stay for a while lest the infection spread, whereas the Spiral *over*-prepared and showed up more than a little late. Drosera probably took advantage of the clan’s upheaval to move out for good and is embarking on the long journey back to the Viridian Labyrinth, and I have no idea what the Spiral’s doing.
	- bee faes: Four little vagabonds who occasionally meet up with dragons in the main clan. Though initially being viewed as a nuisance by the clan, they’re now regarded as allies thanks to their help in a certain event involving too many Imperials. A family in their own right, bound by friendship and a desire to make trouble no matter where they go.
	- other pairs: [Cristofori](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11943858)/[Reverie](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13403583), [RhapsodyInBlue](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13791814)/[LadyInRed](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13791577), [Aeron](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14577448)/[this lookalike](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14653617). The first two are what happens when I forget that same-gender breeding isn’t a thing, and I’m not 100% sure what to do with the Mirror couple but Aeron’s here to stay. Cristofori and Reverie were with \[the main clan] for a while but otherwise none of these dragons have lore.
	- [Fern](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13567780): A silly little thing who’s not tied to any particular group. In other words, yet another dragon I can’t bring myself to get rid of.

	Whoops, time to revamp what little bios my dragons had ~~again~~, isn’t it.

	So as it turns out, my wallet is suffering and unless I find a really fitting Wildclaw to go with the Creeping Circuits accent, I’m probably not gonna get a brand new flight representative this holiday.

	However! [One of my permanent dragons](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11966926) happens to look *fantastic* with the Dancing Conductor accent, so this happened.

	Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m strongly considering incorporating those prosthetic wings into lore, not to mention taking yet *another* dragon out of the main clan. Because I gave up on forcing everyone to live together a long time ago, and while I’m at it, why not throw ‘em all around Sornieth?

	…I haven’t even figured out the details of this Incident™ with Imperials and bee Faes, what do I think I’m doing here exactly. :’D

## 2015 August 19 https://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/post/127098860195

	Worldbuilding Wednesday! Which means I should probably get around to clearing up what this big ominous “incident” is. I’ve had some vague ideas in mind for a while now and it’s about time I actually wrote it down.

	The tl;dr of it is that someone tried to create an Emperor but the plot was foiled by a bunch of Faes. (Warnings for violence and death, but no graphic descriptions.)

	For reference, [here’s a “cast listing”](here-there-be-dragons) - however, you can ignore Apocrypha, Caduceus, and the two representatives (Drosera and that Spiral from Brightsine Jubilee who I still haven’t named), since they weren’t in the clan at the time.
	
	#remind me not to write a small novel about my dragons again #this was fun but it took so long to write down #never mind how long I've been putting these ideas together #anyway I'm putting this in the main tag in the off chance someone will want to read it #it's less a story and more a Wikipedia plot summary but with flavor


	It started with [Cumulonimbus](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11966926). A bright youth from the Shifting Expanse, ae was less than enthralled by aer prospects as an engineer. Why settle for being a cog in the machine when ae was surely capable of so much more?

	Cumulonimbus’ travels brought aer to the Scarred Wasteland. Captivated by Plague’s raw strength, ae vowed ae would make aer mark on the world in these lands.

	Before long, the perfect opportunity presented itself in the form of Maelstrom and Lapilli, wayward dragons establishing their own territory for the first time. Surely they needed assistance with their budding clan. Despite their initial insistence that, no, they weren’t founding a clan and just wanted a place to live, they didn’t protest to Cumulonimbus’ help. Thus the Skydancer found a new home. Ae quickly established aerself as a guard, fighting off anyone who dared intrude on what little territory the trio had.

	Enter [Azurite](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12140008), a lost hatchling from the Sea of a Thousand Currents. The trio took her under their wing(s) without hesitation, and Cumulonimbus was delighted when she too vowed to serve the clan to the best of her ability. Ae personally mentored the Mirror, especially when Maelstrom and Lapilli started raising their own hatchlings.

	Skydancers, however, are not known for brute force. It did not take long for Azurite to overpower her mentor. Proud as Cumulonimbus was, ae could not shake the sense that ae would be replaced.

	Time passed. A newcomer, [Thanatos\*](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11734384), introduced the clan to the idea of exalting - the process of training traveling dragons to serve their deity of choice - and before long he and Azurite were two of three of the clan’s best fighters. (The third, [Solar](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=6594794), doesn’t play much of a role in this story. Sorry about that, old man.) Cumulonimbus’ pride in aer mentee twisted into resentment.

	> \*The name *Thanatos* is a placeholder. The dragon is referred to as *Obsidian* onsite and throughout my blog, although due to various reasons I’m not disclosing publicly, that name is invalid.

	At some point Cumulonimbus learned of Emperor Dragons, a behemoth that rose from the remains of too many fallen Imperials. According to legend, only the deities could defeat such a monster. But suppose that a single clan, if large enough, could subdue it. A single clan with a single dragon at the lead, a shimmering hero with lightning in aer veins and nothing to lose.

	Meanwhile, [some shenanigans with a duo of troublemakers](until-i-get-around-to-writing-up-some-proper-bios) led to a shaky alliance between the growing clan and a tiny colony of striped Faes. The Faes had no desire to officially join the clan, but lingered in the territory nonetheless. It wasn’t the most symbiotic relationship, especially seeing as the Faes couldn’t help but lure unsuspecting foragers into a ditch here and there, but the Faes had the favor of the leaders’ progeny and that was enough.

	Exaltees often encountered the Faes on their way to and from the clan, and through the warrior wannabes the Faes learned of happenings in the clan. The Faes started noticing a pattern: of all the dragons to arrive, Imperials very rarely left. Rumor had it a certain dragon was promising them they were cut out for greater things, and if they stayed they would leave an unforgettable mark in history. No one seemed to have any idea who were making these promises or exactly what these “greater things” were, however.

	After some discussion, the Faes decided to investigate for themselves. [Indil](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13316776), who happened to be close to one of the founder’s progeny ([Riptide](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280264), had the easiest time of this, taking advantage of his meetings with Riptide to learn all he could about the relationships in the clan. Apparently no one was terribly inclined to trust the new Imperials, nor were the leaders happy about having more mouths to feed. But no one wanted to douse their enthusiasm.

	Additionally, the fresh blood happened to be close to Cumulonimbus. They often chose to forego training sessions with Azurite and Thanatos in favor of outings with the Skydancer. Azurite’s relationship with her former mentor had been strained for ages, and this added insult to injury.

	The Faes concluded that Cumulonimbus was plotting an uprising. However, they (correctly) assumed that no one in the clan would take their concerns seriously given their reputation for troublemaking, so they took matters into their own little claws. Thanks largely to the excited rambling of one of the new Imperials, [Schism](https://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12788530), the Faes were able to determine that Cumulonimbus took the Imperials towards the Wyrmwound. They were preparing for something that would take place by the next Riot of Rot.

	Concerned, the Faes argued among themselves about who would risk life and limb to approach the seemingly neverending cauldron of doom. Not Sonnuk, he brought them together. Not Indil, he knew too much. Not Vayne, she had brilliant ideas. Not Ada, she kept the peace. The colony simply would not be the same without any one of them, but they weren’t ready to die together.

	Unfortunately, Schism was spying on them. Fortunately, Schism overheard their desperate debates and suggested they all go under her protection. (As it turns out, Arcane’s natural affinity for magic combined with Plague’s inherent knowledge of disease can create some of the strongest immunity spells known to dragonkind.) She seemed to be under the assumption they were curious and had no further motive, and this would be a simple act of kindness on her part. The Faes didn’t hesitate.

	Thus the quartet learned that Cumulonimbus was preparing a small army of Imperials for conquest and triumph, just as suspected. They all swore they’d be loyal to the Skydancer “to the end and beyond.” And, perhaps most concerning of all, the Imperials were being taught how to fight as a group beyond what a regular army would entail. They fought together. A single-minded entity going beyond a mob mentality.

	They were not individuals. They were an Emperor. And come the Riot of Rot, when Plague dragons were strongest, all eleven Imperials would die near the Wyrmwound, fueled by its deathly aura without being burned alive, and rise as one.

	Schism saw to it that the Faes returned safely, unnoticed by the others. She was disappointed when her question of their opinion was answered by blank and/or horrified stares.

	Filled with renewed fervor, Schism tried talking to Maelstrom and Lapilli. They shouldn’t look at her and the other Imperials with such distaste – and yes, she *had* caught their split-second glares even when they thought no one was paying attention. They were only going out for special training with one of the clan’s first members. Surely there was no reason to distrust Cumulonimbus, who had been serving since day one.

	Or so it seemed, at least, until Riptide returned from a meeting with Indil a while later. Ve appeared to be in some distress and immediately flew off with Maelstrom and Lapilli to talk in private. Schism couldn’t help but overhear – Indil had informed vir that one of the dragons in the clan was plotting against everyone else, but he had been too distraught to say more. Apparently he feared for his life and felt sick just *knowing* this, never mind telling.

	Schism also found this news horrifying. Why would anyone want to tear such a nice little clan apart, especially on the eve of success? Surely it was the Faes starting trouble again, but Riptide was no liar and ve was certain Indil wouldn’t fake such turmoil.

	Maelstrom and Lapilli didn’t make this known. For the time being, they decided, the best thing to do would be acting normal. Don’t say a thing. They didn’t need to stir more drama.

	Nonetheless, Schism felt it was only fair to tell at least one other dragon, that way they could stick together against the unseen evil. Come the next meeting at the Wyrmwound, she revealed to everyone present that someone in the clan was going to start an uprising. Cumulonimbus was horrified and decided they couldn’t put this on hold any longer. Forget the Riot of Rot, the Emperor needed to rise as soon as possible, before the clan tore itself apart.

	On Cumulonimbus’ command, Schism volunteered to inform the leaders of this development. She went above and beyond–she actively summoned the clan to join her and the others back at the Wyrmwound. The Faes, of course, flew into the fray, since they were too deeply intertwined with the clan’s well-being to back out now. Maelstrom wasn’t thrilled to learn that they knew more than he about the entire ordeal.

	Confrontation was inevitable. The clan accused Cumulonimbus of being a traitor. Ae denied these claims, tried to explain, but the Imperials were growing impatient. They had been promised their time was now, why the hesitation? Sort this out later, they had a beast to turn into!

	But Cumulonimbus wasn’t trying to start an uprising. Ae wanted to lead the clan to victory, all of them. Okay, ae would be at the forefront, but only because ae alone could control their greatest weapon. The Emperor would be used to their *benefit*, not against them!

	The Imperials were outraged. How *dare* they be taken advantage of like this, used as a mere tool. Sure, Cumulonimbus had promised them greatness, but they didn’t sign up to be treated like *this*. They hadn’t realized they were being conditioned. Forget being an Emperor, they could overpower this pathetic clan on their own.

	And so all hell broke loose at the edge of a cauldron of death.

	The clan fought as one, ten Imperials fought as one, the Faes stuck together for the clan, and Cumulonimbus – Cumulonimbus, neither a member of the clan nor the commander of anyone but aerself, fled the scene. Ae had done enough damage.

	Key detail: *ten* Imperials. Not all eleven. Schism, ever the wild card, fought for the clan. She had never really been against it - or if she had, it was irrelevant now, because her loyalties had been solidified.

	Though it was seventeen clan-loyal dragons versus ten Imperials, sometimes a natural species advantage makes all the difference. Not only did the clan need to fight off ten Imperials, they needed to keep their foes *alive* lest an Emperor form. And once the ten Imperials realized their foes weren’t fighting to the death, they threw away all inhibition and took full advantage. It didn’t help that the four Faes, try as they might to fight back, could do little more than dodge if they wanted to survive.

	But brute strength can’t always win. After witnessing an Imperial grab a clan mate and throw it into the Wyrmwound, the Faes had an idea. A ridiculous idea, because surely no dragon would be foolish enough to dive towards their doom, but they’d pulled it off before. On a much smaller scale, but nonetheless….

	It was a simple procedure.

	First, have a trap. In some cases this was a ditch, in others a sudden drop on a hillside would do - never enough to cause lasting harm, just a big enough fall for the unsuspecting victim to stay discombobulated long enough for the Faes to grab their spoils and flee. In this case, it would be the Wyrmwound, which would probably cause lasting damage.

	Second, bait. Taunt the dragon. Fly around their head in circles until they can’t ignore the tiny striped menace any longer. Spit poison in their eye if necessary; of course it won’t do much more than sting, but it’ll do. They won’t just want the Fae gone, they’ll want revenge.

	Third and most importantly, switch. Go down right towards the trap, then turn around at the last second. Turn too late and someone’s about to get squished. Turn too early and the foe will catch on. But if done successfully, the unsuspecting victim will be unable to stop themselves and dive headfirst to their doom. Larger dragons simply can’t kill their momentum quickly enough.

	The Faes pulled this off countless times with all sorts of victims, but never an Imperial, and never with their snouts centimeters away from boiling death. And yet.

	Taunt. Bait. Switch. And one after the other, the Faes took ten unsuspecting Imperials to their demise.

	-

	The Faes still had no desire to join the rest of the clan. Too many faces to keep track of, too much personal drama. But they’ve found the clan far more forgiving of their antics, much to their delight.

	Schism, while not necessarily trusted, found a solid place of respect among the clan. She’d much rather play spy and ward off enemy Imperials than use her magic to heal, but she’s proven herself an invaluable ally nonetheless.

	As for Cumulonimbus, Azurite found aer around the edge of the clan’s home. One long and difficult conversation later, Azurite warily led aer back to the clan. Ae resides with the clan to this day, though ae refuses to get close with anyone. Not everyone has forgiven aer, nor does ae expect to be welcomed, and ae would have left on aer own a long time ago had ae not felt deeply indebted for all the trouble.

	The clan has since grown nonetheless and is currently wandering around the Abiding Boneyard in search of a new place to call home. They will not, however, be welcoming any Imperials into their permanent ranks any time soon. And they most certainly will not be trusting Cumulonimbus to the extent they did before all this. (Not that ae cares.)

	They simply move on. There’s no other way to live.
