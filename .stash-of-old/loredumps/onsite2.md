[color=black]Little of Delphi's life before his awakening is known, even by Delphi himself. He'd like to keep it that way. Of three things he is certain: first, he was trained by [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14133744]a dark mirror[/url][color=black]; second, he had a daughter who he allowed to join the ranks of the Windsinger; third, he was weak. The latter reason has dissuaded him from considering the issue further.

A strong dragon would not have gotten lost in the Tangled Wood. A strong dragon, upon finding [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14562462]another[/url][color=black]'s blood on his claws for the first time, would not have been so overwhelmed by regret and guilt he begged for his own demise. Upon receiving pity he would not have groveled yet again. Only after this second rejection of his death wish did the fool realize his true potential lie in the brute force gifted to him since hatching. Delphi emerged from the Wood in a haze of victory and bloodshed, certain four more dragons had fallen at his feet. At last he had learned his lesson.

[center][img]https://68.media.tumblr.com/a26bf027f53754c010781f5c937cb153/tumblr_nj9kyb0AiI1r28672o6_1280.png[/img][/center]

[color=black]Such a life story might give one the impression Delphi is a cold-hearted killer. His jovial encounters with the dragons he met within the brambles must have been tactical ploys, especially as he went on to murder some hours after meeting. This, he would like to assure everyone, is false. Is he hesitant to consider others friends? Yes. Does he have qualms with murder, should the need arise? Absolutely not. Would he like to devote his life to training exaltees for the Plaguebringer? Of course. But what dragons [i]wouldn't[/i]?

In fact, if not for recent circumstances, Delphi might have had a true companion who could attest to his genuine goodwill. [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=20722709]Galena[/url][color=black], the mirror's name was - a fellow survivor of the tangled trials, the ice-eyed mirror never spoke of a past marked by homicide. Yet Delphi had witnessed his strangulation of [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=view&tab=dragon&id=0&did=22333453]a skydancer[/url][color=black], and [i]that[/i] was hardly the work of an amateur killer. No sooner had the shadows cleared, Delphi extended a simple agreement: the duo would travel together, at least until they found their own ways. With little hesitation, Galena accepted.

[center][img]http://68.media.tumblr.com/d48124f289bf2248bc176858519cefbe/tumblr_o8budy2fXI1tddvg0o1_1280.png[/img][/center]

And they could have been friends, they almost [i]were[/i] friends, Delphi believed it. He let his guard down - a near-fatal mistake. One day he dared confess his early life, then spilled out his dreams of becoming an exaltee trainer. Oh, serving a god himself would be one thing, but helping raise a new generation? When Delphi's time came, he would embrace it, but while he still wandered Sornieth he would put his life to even greater use. Imagine the glory! Furthermore, he didn't want to do it alone. Surely Galena would be pleased to be his partner.

Galena hadn't seemed like the type to express pleasure through mauling, yet the state he left Delphi in after the proposal might have implied such. Delphi, for all his strength, couldn't fight back. He didn't raise a claw. Had he tried, he would have been overpowered, but the strength to try escaped him.

Instead Delphi was left bloodied and beaten, his attacker gone for good. When at last he managed to stand, he was heartbroken. Where had he gone wrong? Much as he tried to blame his would-have-been, could-have-been, [i]should[/i]-have-been companion, once more the resolve could not be found. He still wasn't strong enough.

For the time being Delphi has decided not to pursue his former friend. Only when he can prove himself worthy will he try again. While he doubts he'll ever find a dragon quite like Galena, his brief life with a companion has left him more desperate than ever.

He won't be left alone forever. He'll find someone, anyone, as he trains himself past his limits. And someday, Delphi will return.

[color=black]The Southern Icefield is home to Flashpoint, a coalition of stranded Plague dragons who enforce "survival of the fittest" by any means necessary in hopes that exaltees are fully prepared to serve the Filthy One (and, perhaps, seal glory for themselves)... or at least it [i]was[/i], before the Incessant Inferno burned Flashpoint into near-nothingness. Survivors of the surprise attack were forced to choose between loyalty to the Empire or immediate death.

Caught in the fray was a young mirrror, who as a hatchling had been targeted by Flashpoint for exaltation. It passed tests with ease no matter how challenging. By the time the Incessant Inferno set the group ablaze, the youth had forgotten its name (if it ever had one) and was primed to become a warrior. It had no desire to mourn its fallen teachers - the strength of the Incessant Inferno amazed it, and what devotion it had for Plaguebringer shifted onto the Inferno's leader [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=16213216]Vulcan[/url][color=black].

But as much as Vulcan needed warriors for her conquest, she did not need a dragon who was nothing [i]but[/i] a warrior. She paired the mirror up with [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14133744]Apocrypha[/url][color=black], her finest battler, in hopes that he could teach it a lesson or two about not being a fighting machine. The ice mirror eventually settled on an identity for himself and took the name [i]Galena[/i].

The more Galena considered himself an individual, the more he reconsidered his upbringing in Flashpoint. He no longer wanted to fight.

[center][img]https://68.media.tumblr.com/aed6377eb396abbaa7338900db5baea2/tumblr_nj9kyb0AiI1r28672o9_1280.png[/img][/center]

Apocrypha told him about [/color][url=http://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/viral-evolution#Rook]Rook[/url][color=black], another dragon raised to become one of Frostbite's fighters - but Rook could not bring itself to deal the final blow on a dragon who failed the test, and rather than face the repercussions of its failure, it ran away to the Scarred Wasteland. Here Rook found a new home and family in the clan of Viral Evolution. Apocrypha was loyal to the same clan before deflecting to Vulcan, and as far as he was aware, Rook was content.

Enthralled by Rook's story, Galena set out to meet it - only to find that Viral Evolution had disbanded and Rook now serves Plaguebringer. He also learned that Rook took up the job of training exaltees, which disgusted Galena so viscerally that he recanted his goal of ever laying eyes on Rook. Ashamed for ever leaving the Incessant Inferno, which had accepted him even after he stepped down from the role of warrior, Galena returned with his head bowed.

[center][img]https://68.media.tumblr.com/76dfef5c8b60c2727d241511f08b043d/tumblr_o8budy2fXI1tddvg0o7_1280.png[/img][/center]

He found nothing but chaos and shadow. In his absence, the Incessant Inferno had been pulled into the Tangled Wood, not to conquer but to protect a local corven beastclan. Surely Vulcan, brilliant and determined as she was, would never...? Before Galena could meet her again, he was swept into a frenzy of betrayal and bloodshed. Nearly all involved perished in the fray, Vulcan among them.

While Galena's memories of this chain of events are hazy, he knows for certain that, early into the reaping, he murdered [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=view&tab=dragon&id=0&did=22333453]a young skydancer[/url][color=black] with his own claws. Ultimately, there were three survivors: [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13483458]Pestilence[/url][color=black], a fellow Viral Evolution outcast and Apocrypha's mentor who in his grief vanished without a word to the other two; [/color]another Plague mirror, [url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=15585543]Delphi[/url][color=black], left with impressions of victory and even greater bloodshed than any other contender; and Galena himself.

[center][img]https://68.media.tumblr.com/a26bf027f53754c010781f5c937cb153/tumblr_nj9kyb0AiI1r28672o6_1280.png[/img][/center]

Delphi acknowledged that Galena was a far more seasoned killer than he and offered, if not friendship, an alliance from one survivor to another. Galena might have turned tail without hesitation, but when his own claws had been stained with blood once more, who was he to take the high ground? The homeless wanderers stayed together for a time, their regard for one another more twisted than the Foxfire Bramble. Life seemed almost peaceful, if hanging by a thread.

The string snapped when Delphi confessed that, not only had he allowed his daughter to be exalted to the Windsinger, he wanted to train exaltees and thought Galena could be his partner. Galena, however, considered a dragon better dead than eternally devoted to a thankless god. Horrified, he struck out, then fled just before dealing the final blow.

Galena cannot afford to have regrets. He upholds his vow to never fight again, not in any circumstance but self-defense (if even that), and seeks a method to his existence's madness. Ice, Shadow, and Plague have left bitter tastes in his mouth. Though he's sworn he'll never idolize anything or anyone again, old habits die hard.

[color=#565d48]Despite being a Shadow dragon, [b][color=#392d43]Carnation Winterbloom[/color][/b] hasn’t been to the Tangled Wood in years. She was minding her own darn business when a bunch of strangers caused a ruckus in the equivalent of her front lawn. After hearing a dragon or two had ties to an Ice clan called Flashpoint, Carnation decided to fly over and scratch some sense into the frigid lizards herself.

But someone beat her to the punch. The original Flashpoint, a group of Plaguebringer-loyal dragons who trained themselves and “recruited” hatchlings in the harshest conditions the Icefield had to offer, had been conquered by a... traveling army? nomadic empire? The story changes depending on who’s telling, but the leaders were assuredly taken captive and have not been seen since.

One would think this would be the end of them, but [i]noooooo[/i]. Dragons in the area continually try to revive the brutal society, and Carnation will have none of it. She’s more than happy to train an exaltee or two herself if it means keeping them out of Flashpoint’s twitching clutches. On occasion she politely informs wannabe founders that their plans are terrible and they should feel bad. Some respect their elders more than others, and those who don’t can expect a good tail smacking.

Her skin and wings are starting to crack from frostbite. Sections that haven’t grow colder and more solid by the day. But if she [i]must[/i] turn into a statue then so be it. She’d like to be placed somewhere her presence will continue scaring the fur off passing travelers. Even in eternal magic-fueled still life, no fool gets by Carnation. No one.*

[color=#b13a3a]At a young age, [b][color=#2d0102]Raizel Griffin[/b][color=#b13a3a] grew tired of the Stormcatcher’s incessant screaming. Hurry this, schedule that - can’t a dragon work on her own terms? Her interests instead shifted towards peculiar substances of the liquid kind, especially those which (metaphorically, but sometimes literally) turn a dragon’s head inside out when consumed.

She learned the hard way that liquid and mechanics do not mix. After spilling a concoction on someone’s priceless project, Raizel soared overseas to the Scarred Wasteland, hoping to pursue her interests in peace. Though she’s hardly an expert brewster, her strawberry daiquiris are electrifying.

Raizel is keen to share her creations with those brave enough to handle the, er, [i]side effects[/i].
Dragons willing to try her “potions” should note that a warning label is not included. This is the coolest thing since blended croaker leg and she does not take constructive criticism.

Isn’t this white wolf pelt creepy enough? Now stop staring.[/center]

[color=#292b38]Though spoiled from a young age, [b]Midst[/b] has never been interested in attention or socialization. Anyone who makes eye contact finds their gaze met blankly, and he seems to derive neither elation from praise nor despair from rejection. Surely, his neighbors thought, he must be possessed.

When hatchlings began disappearing, the blame fell on Midst, and he was banished from town for life. Wordlessly he left, and he has not returned since.

(Whether the village has been able to determine the true cause of their missing youth remains unknown to this day. A neighboring clan known later as Flashpoint, brutal warriors of the Plaguebringer who train in the harshest conditions the Southern Icefield has to offer, may have been involved. But this matters not to Midst.)

No matter where he goes, calamity and disaster seem to follow. Midst has lost track of the rumors he’s overheard, the number of times he’s played scapegoat. At this point, however, he seems to like it that way. He bothers no one who doesn’t bother him. And no one bothers a potential killer.

Except when they do. Lately Midst has been spotted with fellow mystery wannabes, a ridgeback with awkward apparel and a skydancer with void wings. Are they causing mischief? mayhem? simply banding together for mutual support? Regardless, they seem to be the only dragons who can truly communicate with Midst. If asked if he’s content with them, Midst nods expressively as he can.
