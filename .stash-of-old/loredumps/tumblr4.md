	# lair purge again no problem
	
	can’t be bothered to make a new page >8V

	TL;DR the Incessant Inferno failed miserably as did the corven alliance, the corven leader duo vanished ages ago and the Inferno followed suit. ~mysterious shadow shenanigans~ I guess…?

	> Lux wanted to be a Light representative for hir first Brightshine Jubilee. Sie hatched a few days after the holiday ended and for all intents and purposes should have waited, but sie does not know patience and set out as soon as possible. On one hand, this was a great idea, since sie had the chance to build up an immunity to the Scarred Wasteland’s plagues when hir immune system was at its strongest. On the other hand, by the time sie found a clan, sie had completely forgotten where hir home was back in the Sunbeam Ruins.
	>
	> Thus Lux lived with Viral Evolution for a time. However, sie was always something of an outcast, and when hir friend Apocrypha left to serve Empress-masquerading-as-representative Vulcan, sie tagged along. Lux has devoted hir life to representing Light, which makes hir an outcast among a clan poised to conquer an empire in the Ashfall Waste, and sie isn’t quite as devoted as other members of the Incessant Inferno. However, once Lux gets an idea, sie cannot be dissuaded; if Vulcan can push hir towards the right ideas, sie can talk the enemy into submission long before teeth are bared.
	>
	> The Incessant Inferno’s move to Shadow terrifies Lux, but for the sake of knowledge, sie is shoving hir irrationality aside. Sie would really like to know the goalposts have moved, however.

	- Hatchday - June 16, 2015
	- Level 25 - STR 129 / AGI 8 / DEF 5 / QCK 50 / INT 5 / VIT 13 / MND 5

	> Apocrypha joined Viral Evolution along with another stray hatchling, Caduceus. They found the clan after an Incident that, though it had occurred quite some time ago, had such an impact on Viral Evolution that they were less than enthusiastic to welcome more new members. Another dragon who received such a treatment was the spiral-turned-mirror Pestilence, who Apocrypha saw as an older sibling. Despite having an affinity for writing, Apocrypha felt that ze was unwanted because ze could not make zirself useful. At least Caduceus was training as a mage and Pestilence’s weird science shenanigans gave some dragons a desired appearance change; all Apocrypha could do was scribble in dirt.
	>
	> Then along came Vulcan, masquerading as a Fire representative. She had no trouble identifying the clan’s outcasts and spoke with each of them personally, promising a life of recognition and belonging if they joined her growing empire. Apocrypha swore zir loyalty over with fervor and devoted zirself to becoming the strongest warrior Vulcan had ever seen. Eventually ze calmed down, but not before molding zirself into a force to be reckoned with, both on the battlefield and on paper. As it turned out, being a scribe was useful for sending letters of warning to weaker clans - join the Incessant Inferno now, or face certain assimilation. Thank you, and enjoy your freedom while it lasts!
	>
	> Ze never got to put zir skills to use as much as ze wanted to. Just when the Incessant Inferno was preparing for the deciding battle against Vulcan’s lost empire, Vulcan decided it wasn’t time just yet. The army resumed their travels. And on the last day of Trickmurk Circus, Vulcan announced that the Inferno had aligned with a beastclan in the Tangled Wood. It’s a far cry from the promised glory, and Apocrypha isn’t the only one who senses that something is off with Vulcan.
	>
	> As the Incessant Inferno wanders into the shadows, Apocrypha tries to stay close to zir Empress. Not that ze has many reservations about fighting for a beastclan, but ze needs to know what caused such a dramatic change of plans. It looks as though the Incessant Inferno will be making history - but not in the ways they’ve been promised.

	(after dissolution of II, decided to serve Plaguebringer once and for all to see his old friends etc, not necessarily as a warrior - Lux joined zir as Gay Bros? also trained Delphi. will miss Pestilence but understands that his unofficial sibling would like to stick around, maybe become a bogsneak. maybe throw on a pendant or something as a keepsake, kinda like Lapilli’s crown :’)?)

	- Hatchday - April 1, 2015
	- Level 7 - STR 7 / AGI 14 / DEF 10 / QCK 10 / INT 25 / VIT 15 / MND 20
	- Length 8.25M / Wingspan 9.46M / Weight 1062.29KG
	- Maize Tiger / Maize Current / Rose Crackle

	> A gifted mage since hatching, Cristofori once hoped to devote his talents to none other than the Arcanist. As part of an effort to expand his skills as much as possible, he ended up in the Scarred Wasteland along with two other exaltee-wannabes. The trio soon began training within a clan known as Viral Evolution; one dragon changed his mind about exaltation and sought out a new clan, but the other two - Cristofori and an imperial named Swiftrunner - remained.
	>
	> Life in Viral Evolution seemed more promising than neverending servitude. Cristofori finally learned to take a break from his studies, primarily thanks to two of the clan’s founding members and one other dragon. One of the oldies was Solar, another Arcane coatl who Cristofori enjoyed swapping stories with. The other founder Cumulonimbus, a skydancer who once wanted to be a hero but had since pushed those plans to the wayside. The third and significantly newer clanmate was Reverie, a shimmering imperial with some reservations towards Cumulonimbus.
	>
	> Though Cristofori took pity on Cumulonimbus, Reverie’s hesitations eventually came to fruition. Cumulonimbus seemingly betrayed Viral Evolution by attempting to raise an Emperor, and during the chaos following this revelation, Swiftrunner was one of ten imperials who perished in the Wyrmwound. To Cristofori and Reverie’s disgust, the murderers were lauded as heroes by a majority of the clan.
	>
	> When Reverie expressed a strong desire to leave Viral Evolution, Cristofori worked to train a replacement mage. During this time, his skydancer ex - who fled no sooner had the fight broken out - returned. Cristofori wasted no time with the replacement’s training, then joined Reverie for good.
	>
	> Or so he thought. They traveled together for some time before crossing paths with Empress Vulcan, whose promises of glory convinced Cristofori to join her growing army. (Reverie was less than impressed and their relationship has been on-and-off since.) Cristofori currently serves as head mage within the Incessant Inferno, though he’s baffled by the move to the Tangled Wood and is considering that, once again, Reverie’s inhibitions might be the better path after all.
	>
	> [right]Solar used to wear a pink birdskull headdress as armor, so Cristofori wears a similar piece of apparel as a pseudo-souvenir from his old friend. Reverie thinks it’s silly. Cristofori agrees and wears it anyway because Solar is a silly dragon.
	>
	> [sub][i][last updated April 4, 2016][/i][/right]

	(based on Reverie’s description (also copied below) these two could’ve either A. joined the Lightweaver together to be happy gays forever or B. split dramatically while Reverie watched everything fall apart. leaning towards the second option honestly…)

	> [center][url=http://www1.flightrising.com/forums/baz/1317940][img]http://i.imgur.com/RrhLijZ.png[/img][/url][/center]
	>
	> Words simply cannot describe exactly how fed up this dragon is with just about everything. Light’s neverending yearning for knowledge has manifested in Reverie not as a goal but as an eternal dissatisfaction with life, the world, and everyone inhabiting it (Reverie included). Bliss can only be found in sweet, sweet dreams.
	>
	> Not that Reverie’s entire life has been misery. Being an imperial is nothing to scorn, and for a relatively solitary dragon, survival has never been particularly difficult. In an attempt to spice things up, Reverie attempted to live in the Scarred Wasteland - only to find a place in the clan of Viral Evolution. Also among the clan’s ranks was Cristofori, a magic-obsessed mage who Reverie taught to chill and subsequently formed a convoluted romantically-inclined relationship with.
	>
	> Then some events fueled by envy and vengeance started tearing Viral Evolution apart. Inevitably. Reverie waited just long enough for Cristofori to train up a replacement mage before they both took their leave. This seemed like a good setup until the leader of a growing army, Vulcan, persuaded Cristofori to join her ranks. However, Reverie’s lack of drive did not appeal to Vulcan and she didn’t waste her breath. This divide upset Cristofori, so Reverie tagged along without formally joining just to keep him company while he integrated into the Incessant Inferno.
	>
	> Unfortunately for the Light dragon, the army has taken a sharp turn towards the Tangled Wood. Continued misfortune comes as no surprise to Reverie. However, paths in the shadows have a way of twisting together until everything is chaos. Reverie can’t [i]wait[/i] for that.

	> Once upon a time, there was a proud dragon. No other dragon’s scales were as pure as his, none could match his mental brilliance, and the wings of even fellow male imperials fell short of his. The Shifting Expanse could ask for nothing greater than his glory.
	>
	> And then he realized that there are hundreds if not [i]thousands[/i] of dragons exactly like him, if not better. Iridescent white scales, shimmering rose wings. His self-sustained pedestal smashed into millions of in-congruent pieces. He forfeited his right to a name and slunk away into the abysses of the Shifting Expanse’s canyons to feel sorry for himself for the rest of eternity.
	>
	> Eventually he was found by a lone traveler, a Lightning-born skydancer whose words also echoed of disillusionment. However, whereas the imperial’s fall from grace was a quiet discovery, the skydancer’s pride had exploded in aer face. Yet ae kept traveling, and aer perseverance ignited a new drive within the imperial. He may not be the best of dragonkind, but he could be better than [i]this[/i].
	>
	> The skydancer, Altostratus, stuck around long enough for him to learn aer story. No sooner was he able to fend for himself, ae disappeared in the night. He never got a chance to thank aer for saving not only his life but his will to live. Determined to ensure ae knows of aer objectively positive influence, he has devoted himself to finding his shiny white brethren.

	>
	> Vulcan was once the wise and benevolent empress of a powerful clan in the Ashfall Waste. She’s still wise and benevolent (or so she considers herself), but her empire fell to a rival clan’s conquest. Thus she began recruiting dragons from all over Sornieth into a new empire, the Incessant Inferno; in exchange for their loyalty, they would win power, riches, and glory beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. All they needed to do was help her reclaim her throne.
	>
	> Fate, however, is cruel. When the Incessant Inferno was finally prepareing for the battle of the eon, Vulcan discovered that her former empire was no more. It hadn’t been overtaken by a new clan, it simply fell apart, and its land had been overtaken smaller allied clans. Though the Incessant Inferno possessed more than enough strength to steamroll the newer clans, it would not be nearly the same as the glorious battle Vulcan had foretold. These clans were pathetic; the Incessant Inferno would need to [i]earn[/i] the status of empire, not just win one battle and be done with it.
	>
	> Not a single doubt in her abilities prevented Vulcan from switching goals. She had led an empire before and could easily do so again, even if she had to rebuild from next to nothing (relatively speaking). But this would mean telling the Incessant Inferno, many of whom were pulled in with promises of instant gratification*, that the goalposts of glory had jumped to some unclear state in the distant future. The other members were dragons from conquered clans, who were forced to choose between loyalty and death, and would likely not stay loyal if they saw the opportunity to leave.
	>
	> Rather than face a potential target from her formidable forces, Vulcan hastily declared that the grand battle would be postponed. They needed more time. It was a blow to her reputation for sure, but not fatal, and better than admitting she had chosen a target that no longer existed. There would be no satisfaction in continued smaller conquest, then saying it was worth it for the allies they made along the way.
	>
	> In fact, the Incessant Inferno had no alliances. When a Shadow “representative” proposed an alliance with a beastclan in the newly-discovered Ghostlight Ruins, Vulcan accepted without hesitation. The Tangled Wood is a dangerous place; with any luck, the Inferno will be snuffed out, and anyone who makes it out will be left to wonder about their noble leader who mysteriously disappeared in the darkness. Vulcan, who is certain she won’t lose herself to the shadows, would rather be mourned a potential winner than admit to picking the wrong battle.
	>
	> [right]note: Vulcan should still be wearing a (torn and ragged) Firebreather Cape, not the scarf that comes with the Burnished Filigree Breastplate. The apparel didn’t layer well, though.

# 2017 June 17 https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/161934854409

	lair plans brainstorming TBD

	- are we gettin the gang back together it looks like we are

	- but for what purpose. “they’re misfits stuck totether now I guess” is what led to all this haphazard drama mess in the first place

	- there can still be haphazard drama just not with like five subgroups

	- are we leaning to casual decent chill times or serious heavy plotting overall. jokey tone WITH serious heavy plotstuff??

	- literally just give them (and by extension yourself) a *goal*

	- roles are good!! they can change but they’re a good starting point

	- as is there’s a handful of cliques: old fogeys, workshop crew, reincarnated randos, tree hippies, and then misc “are they actually in lore or not??” lizards like avi and fodder factories

	- oh my god why do I have so many first gens

	- train and resell those suckers someday you already got a solid page of keepers and that’s a nice arrangement

	- having a G1 only lair is nice in theory but *gem prices are soaring do you really want this*

	- maybe hoard for plague? you don’t need all that space man you exalt one page it takes you all day

	- …a hotel of sorts would be interesting

	- oh sure come up with a uniting concept the second you gotta leave gg

## 2017 June 20 https://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/162064101319

	before I forget, very very rough lore ideas

	> get the gang together, old and new alike. Again. but they’re not lost this time and for the love of rotmom please no factions
	
	> similar to VE but the overall focus is on training exaltees AND keeping away random zombies in the proximity (fodder kids)
	
	> fodder pairs are kinda just those weird kinda creepy neighbors no one dares interact with
	
	> G1 hoard & fodder in waiting are guests?? huge shelter, still leans naturalistic but they can build stuff
	
	> no one’s tied to the place and they don’t necessarily have “jobs but specialized distribution of labor is a thing
	
	> no sense of Clan Pride, think more motel than cat hell. may change later but for now just work with thisover “exalting is evil” ideal
	
	> maybe let Alto run the place? but definitely consulting progens & Solar. she’s a changed dragon and that includes not taking everything by the reins alone
	
	> Pestilence returns as bogsneak, screw trying to be accepted he’s weird and he’s gonna embrace it
	
	> Schism still primarily in charge of exaltee training, affiliated with Rivi & Gizmo at Workshop. GW crew occasionally includes Fern, Drosera & treeancer?
	
	> Notturno is a merchant and totally not a thief, gathers supplies and brings in $$$ (which no one else cares about)
	
	> Delphi & unnamed mirror G1s (Vulcan-related, random blue) guard. zombie hunters. Yes
	
	> Galena isn’t gonna be happy about this but he can chill on the outskirts? awkward son-like relationship with progen pair but cant get 
	
	> G1 nocturnes raised brown mirror G1, both magicians. possible friendly rivalry with Pestilence?
	
	> avi and carnation continue to Just Be There
	
	> –WAIT LIKE. MERCENARY TRAINING THOUGH
	
	> sometimes guests are off to Plaguebringer sometimes they’re gonna leave after training doesn’t matter no one cares just don’t start any major ruckus and you can chill as long as you want

[headcanonrising](https://headcanonrising.tumblr.com/post/157429348180):
	> Headcanon that the runes gene spread quickly from arcane into water because it actually helped some dragons underwater see in dark waters and trenches due to the runes being able to glow.

	Bioluminescent dragons are *my aesthetic* but it’s got more purposes than visual aid! Consider the following:

	- A cluster of deep sea faes flittering along the currents. From a distance they look like a twinkling night sky; a close observer might notice a complex communication system, a morse code of light few from above would understand.
	
	- ^But that’s only if you *can* get close enough. It only takes one to see you before they scatter in a flash, leaving you dazed in darkness once more.
	
	- Deep sea pearlcatchers whose vanity ovrrides scarcity of meeting and thus engage in elaborate courtship rituals. One would be ill advised to interfere, but when you’re so entranced by the swirling lights, does the thought even cross your mind?
	
	- Deep sea mirrors–or are they? It’s hard to make out much of anyone down here, but you’re fairly certain you could decipher those runes if you just got a *little* closer…. Only too late do you look up to meet a mass of crooked fangs, having swum right into the claws of a ravenous predator.
	
	- A deep sea bogsneak or a murky mass? You can’t tell. You don’t *want* to know. No bacteria known to anyone but those who spend hours hunched over cauldrons make colors like these. They illuminate the rows upon rows of mutated fins that somehow look far less natural.
	
	- Deep sea spirals with [tubular eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM9o4VnfHJU) lurking among trenches just snug enough for their elongated bodies. In the open ocean, attack can come from any direction; lest you forget to watch out below, such winding beasts can lunge from afar.
	
	- And at the very bottom of the sea, sprawled around [fissures to the void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent) like strangled seaweed - a piece of antler here, a trace of whisker there. Do imperials who throw their dead to the waves know what [ecosystems](https://vimeo.com/29987934) they’re founding? What happens if the deepest dwellers avoid taking refuge among the ribcage? Is that carcass still glowing? Say, how close can imperials lie before conglomerating into a beast too horrific for words…?
