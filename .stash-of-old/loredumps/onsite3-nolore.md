[indent][columns][font=georgia][size=4][color=#566453][b]It all started when Amaranta hatched.[/b]

"This was around 3 days ago. When we came home the day after our birthday, we found this lady there and she'd stolen all my stuff," Amaranta said.

"She broke all the stuff. All my clothes, my jewelry, my money from my paycheck, and everything. She put a bunch of it in her box and I didn't even know what it was. So, I called her and said I need my mother. I asked what's going on and she said 'I want my mother,' and then she went back to her place and I called her again, but her phone died and she never answered."

Amaranta and her mother met that night and Amaranta met her and her mother talked until the woman took the $300 she got from Amaranta's birthday.

"I got her and she said, 'No, you have to pay or I will beat your head on.' And I said okay, I have to find my mom," Amaranta said.

Amaranta got help from a friend's mother's boyfriend but they decided [url=https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/frd/2678856/9#post_38884486][color=#652127]it was best[/color][/url][/color][/size][nextcol][color=#eee]x[/color][/columns][/indent][/font]
