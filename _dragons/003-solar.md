### lore notes
- loves him a good [glow star](https://www1.flightrising.com/game-database/item/132)
- one of the first dragons to stumble upon the clan later known as Viral&nbsp;Evoultion; kinda just showed up, sat down, and proceeded to become a beloved mainstay!
- jovial uncle-figure to Azurite, who dubbed him "Weenie McNubs," and generally appreciated by others as the oldest dragon present
- drama happened and he saw himself out, but he keeps in touch


### Archaeoraptor notes
He is literally just vibin'. Solar's been around since the earliest days of my lair, and in all honesty I do not remember exactly how I got him or from whom, but he *was* a gift and I cherish him. The only apparel piece I picture him with is the bulb, if even that, but he looks swell all decked out, too.

Lore bonus: There was some sort of in-joke about him getting lost on his way to the fridge for a snack run, which translated to that lore about seeking stars in the Icefield. The nickname "Weenie McNubs" originated from the same conversation. I don't remember how all that happened, either.
