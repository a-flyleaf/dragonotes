   I got this familiar pretty early; not the first, but almost definitely a Coliseum drop. Thought the "charge headfirst into overwhelming odds" snippet fit Alto's lore at the time, and it's stuck since.

### lore notes
this is a Bit of a mess because Alto's lore basically encompasses a couple significant eras of my lair, but for lack of a history page it's all getting squished here for now. pardon the tangents!

#### Viral Evolution
- once a wandering would-be warrior; upon meeting [Maelstrom](maelstrom) and [Lapilli](lapilli), pledged herself to their service
- helped raise the orphan [Azurite](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/12140008), but Azurite quickly surpassed her mentor, to Alto's chagrin
- in an attempt to "help" the clan better, plotted to raise an Emperor---by recruiting eleven unwitting imperials, Schism included
- plan was revealed via friend-of-a-friend shenanigans (Schism was friends with the "bee faes" (survived today only by Riviana), who uncovered the plot) and a bunch of drama happened
- ultimately, all the imperials but Schism fell to the Wyrmwound, and Altostratus was promptly exiled

#### lost
- [I wrote a scene at one point about Azurite encountering Alto post-exile, but idk if it's saved anywhere]
- wanderings took Alto back to the Shifting&nbsp;Expanse for some good self-reflection. in no particular order:
- wings broke; got them replaced/supplemented by prosthetics
- found a stray Fire egg who later hatched into Gizmo; "raised" it from afar but never got too close
- eventually wound up in the Tangled&nbsp;Wood, and met the corven beastclan Cryptocelus in the Ghostlight&nbsp;Ruins. Alto allied with them in an attempt to help fight back dragons who'd "discovered" the venue, but it all got lost to the shadows... <small><i>[read: I lost interest and did a lair purge<!--see: Flight Reaping-->]</i></small>

#### and since then...
- later, reunited with Maelstrom & Lapilli [trained to level&nbsp;25 together]; parted on much better terms
- ambiguously wandering since, with no strong allegiance neither elemental nor clan-wise. but reportedly she's doin' good

### Archaeoraptor notes
We love an atoner. Alto's story covers most of Viral&nbsp;Evolution's, and I haven't really known what do with her lore-wise since, but I think she's cool. And although I've occasionally toyed with the thought of changing her genes, her outfit's pretty complex and I'm happy with how she looks as-is :>

As a side note, she has three offspring---[Asher](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/13421444), [Brook](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/13421445), and [Codi](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/13421446)---who themselves don't have lore, but their father [Cristofori](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/11943858) did! He was Viral&nbsp;Evolution's healer for a while; but his BFF/partner [Reverie](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/13403583) was one of the imperials dragged into Alto's Emperor-raising scheme. Needless to say Cristofori wasn't happy about that; whatever relationship he and Alto had was severed at the revelation.
