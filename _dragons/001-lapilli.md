### lore notes
- original [colony](https://www1.flightrising.com/wiki/wiki/article/fae-dragons) fell apart due to reasons I've since forgotten
- met [Maelstrom](maelstrom), who would become a partner for life
- enter Altostratus, Azurite, and Solar; then the hatchlings, Chalcedony & Riptide---and with that, a clan was born
- though both progens were technically leaders, Maelstrom never set out to leave a clan; Lapilli took on most responsibilities, which she enjoyed despite occasional overwhelm
- the clan (later dubbed <i>Viral&nbsp;Evolution</i>) eventually dissolved due to a whole â€™nother mess of interpersonal drama; following this, Lapilli joined Maelstrom for wandering around the plaguelands
	- bone crown was a parting gift from the kids; has not taken it off since
	- took on the surname "Virevo" in honor of the clan
- has occasionally taken interest in other territories, particularly the Tangled&nbsp;Wood; for now she's rarely been apart from Maelstrom long, but time will tell if their paths diverge more significantly....

### Archaeoraptor notes
On one hand, blue is my favorite color, and as eternal proof of that luck I'm not particularly tempted to scatter her. On the other, I am increasingly aware of the aesthetic mismatch. If I ever get [that progen restoration achievement](https://www1.flightrising.com/game-database/achievement/134), it'll probably be with her, and with a fresh makeover the second she pops out of the Wyrmwound. Or Tangled&nbsp;Wood. Or... however I justify that makeover, lore-wise.
