### lore notes
- original [colony](https://www1.flightrising.com/wiki/wiki/article/fae-dragons) fell apart due to reasons I've since forgotten
- met [Maelstrom](maelstrom), who would become a partner for life
- enter [Altostratus](altostratus), Azurite, and Solar; then the hatchlings, Chalcedony & Riptide---and with that, a clan was born
- though both progens were technically leaders, Maelstrom never set out to leave a clan; Lapilli took on most responsibilities, which she enjoyed despite occasional overwhelm
- the clan (later dubbed <i>Viral&nbsp;Evolution</i>) eventually dissolved due to a whole â€™nother mess of interpersonal drama; following this, Lapilli joined Maelstrom for wandering around the plaguelands
	- bone crown was a parting gift from the kids; has not taken it off since
	- took on the surname "Virevo" in honor of the clan
- has occasionally taken interest in other territories, particularly the Tangled&nbsp;Wood, but always returns to the plaguelands
- Riot of Rot 2024: took a dip in the Wyrmwound and came out different!

### Archaeoraptor notes
Used to have [slightly different genes](../assets/img/dragons/oldver/12116085_350.png)! I never wanted to scatter away the blue, but that Coral tert has been difficult to work with, and I wanted to keep the bone crown for lore reasons no matter how much it stuck out. Several years and new genes later, she finally got a makeover for Halloween---and net me [the progen restoration achievement](https://www1.flightrising.com/game-database/achievement/134) while she was at it! The whole venture was [archived: before, during, and after exaltation](https://archive.is/https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/12116085). At long last, Lapilli finally looks like the busy little Plagueling she's always been at heart <3
