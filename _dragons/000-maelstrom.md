### lore notes
- grew up in a roving pack of mirrors not unlike those described in [the official encyclopedia](https://www1.flightrising.com/wiki/wiki/article/mirror-dragons)
- interpersonal conflict split the pack, and Maelstrom wandered off solo
- met [Lapilli](lapilli), who would become a partner for life
- enter [Altostratus](altostratus), Azurite, and Solar; then the hatchlings, Chalcedony & Riptide---and with that, a clan was born
- though both progens were technically leaders, Lapilli took on most duties in practice; Maelstrom, ever the loner, mostly didn't feel the need to organize and helped around where needed
- the clan (later dubbed <i>Viral&nbsp;Evolution</i>) eventually dissolved due to a whole â€™nother mess of interpersonal drama; following this, Maelstrom and Lapilli wandered the plaguelands on their own
	- took on the surname "Virevo" in honor of the clan
- Lapilli has occasionally stuck her snout in other territories, namely the Tangled&nbsp;Wood, though she and Maelstrom are rarely apart long
- forever wandering the Abiding&nbsp;Boneyard

### Archaeoraptor notes
Maelstrom, my guy Maelstrom! I do not remember what possessed me to make him purble, but it probably had something to do with Shadow being my second-choice flight. It's been tricky to make his genes and apparel work, especially with the red eyes, but I like what I've landed on---even if, character-wise, the most fitting look would be no apparel and triple Basic. Aesthetics win this round.
