	also dredge up
	- v1/lore/profile: 2020-01-07
	- about/flowchart
	- /biomaker/ (or it can just Sit There if we're still working on it)
	- +extra stuff in the site/fr folder

	^all these (and more on other minisites) can go on some revamped shriblets linkhub tbh. there are So Many and they are So Scattered

[2024-11-29] also maybe trawl gdocs for stuff I can save here onsite instead

[2024-12-25] revisit that bio generator maybe... particularly for fandragons bc there are So Many

[2025-02-02] UPDATE SKIPTRACE once he gets his new outfit!! which... will probably be in August at the earliest (warrior's way apparel...), but the note is Here.

[2025-02-04] futz with the dragons.html template to automatically integrate art from the data. could do the same for familiars, scenes, and vistas; skin/outfit stuff can be page-specific.
	also just go ahead and save all the art, individual pages be damned. first of all this'll save me SO much time down the road (it can be styled per-page with a class that's like "a1,a2,a3" forloop shit); second and moreover, automatic updating on the /dragons index! yippee!!
