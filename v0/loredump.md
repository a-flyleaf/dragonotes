# Maelstrom

purple, black, red

Maelstrom Swarmtail-Virevo, designated loner

There's something ironic about the life of a dragon who left his first pack due to a power struggle, accidentally founded and subsequently half-led his own clan, watched that clan fall apart as interpersonal tensions boiled over, and finally found peace by getting miserably lost. Yet such is the life of Maelstrom. His name was not supposed to be symbolic.

After swearing off clan life, Maelstrom spent his days wandering between the Scarred Wasteland and Tangled Wood. On occasion he was joined by his partner Lapilli, whose company he enjoyed, though ultimately he wanted to be left alone. Forever.

Naturally, that didn't work out. The chaos swallowed just about everyone whole, new and old faces alike. Maelstrom doesn't remember much in clarity and doesn't care to. What he knows for certain, however, is that he was devastated by fleeting moments when he and Lapilli thought they would be separated for good.

For reasons unknown the duo's fates seem intertwined. Since escaping the turmoil they've wandered together, minding no one's business but their own, just as they like it.

â€”

Everything worked out better than expected. The first colony literally crumbled, then the clan tore itself apart at the tendons, and just when everything fell to pieces, Lapilli found purpose in simplicity.

After a disaster that destroyed her colony, Lapilli attempted to take as much control of her life as possible. Upon meeting Maelstrom, the duo unintentionally founded a clan later known as Viral Evolution, in which Lapilli secured a position of leadership. She attempted to keep herself on top of of the clan's happenings without being overbearing. However, some grudges went undetected until it was too late. Ultimately, Lapilli and Maelstrom were left alone once more.

Having taken on the roles of both subordinate and superior, Lapilli concluded that neither offers her any sense of security. It also occurred to her that she has no memory of life in her colony other than the "fact" it existed. The answers she sought took her towards the shadows. But thanks to a sequence of events too tangled for anyone to recall, she decided she was better off not knowing.

Nonetheless, her and Maelstom's fates seem intertwined. Since escaping the turmoil they've wandered together, minding no one's business but their own, just as they like it.


[right]The crown of bones was a parting gift from Chalcedony and Riptide. It doesn't fit but Lapilli didn't have the heart to tell them otherwise. Nowadays she keeps it as a fond token of bygone days.

[sub]Speckle added 6/11/15, Eye Spots on 3/19/18 (long after Riptide's exaltation); lore-wise she's always had both.

However, when she mentored [/color][url=http://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/Viral-Evolution#Azurite]a stray mirror[/url][color=black], her fighting skills were gravely overshadowed. Envy gnawed at pride for her mentee. Not content to live a life of bug catching, Cumulonimbus plotted to raise an Emperor, the unholy amalgamation of eleven imperials bathed in the Wyrmwound. It was easy enough to convince eleven would-be-exaltees to join her special training sessions, during which she groomed them into loyalty and obedience.

It was not so easy to execute this plan. Thanks to [/color][url=http://archaeoraptor-archive.tumblr.com/Viral-Evolution#Indil]a quartet of nosy faes[/url][color=black] and apparent miscommunication, the clan turned against Cumulonimbus. They accused her of raising the emperor to destroy them all in revenge, when those were hardly her intentions. She wanted to [i]control[/i] the beast for everyone's benefit, not sic it on them. Ten of the eleven imperials, upon hearing this, refused to throw themselves into the Wyrmwound and attacked. Unwilling to deal with the consequences, Cumulonimbus fled.

[center][img]http://68.media.tumblr.com/ec25a86aa52367906cef5fe9a01f8f45/tumblr_nj9kyb0AiI1r28672o7_1280.png[/img][/center]

[color=black]Aching for a place to call home again, the skydancer returned to the lands of her hatching, scarcely able to recall why she'd left in the first place. She changed her name to [i]Altostratus[/i] in hopes her past wouldn't follow. However, during her travels through the canyons of the Shifting Expanse, she stumbled upon [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=3431604]a weakened imperial[/url] who knew nothing of her exploits. This was the perfect opportunity to start anew. Yet as she helped him recover, she couldn't help but open up. No sooner was he able to fend for himself, Altostratus left once more.

The caretaker became the patient when she broke her wings. Why, hadn't she seen the storm brewing ahead? A local Lightning clan reinforced Altostratus' wings with the sparks and metal of her birth flight. Much as she accepted their hospitality, she felt unworthy of such kindness. When they discovered her roots in the Scarred Wasteland they sent her away at once, fearing the spread of doormant disease.

On the way out, she raised [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&id=138250&tab=dragon&did=18345336]a stray egg[/url][color=black] within the Golem Workshop. The youth followed Altostratus to the edges of the Expanse before she finally shook it off. A mother she had been once, and her relationships with both her progeny and her mate fell through the cracks. Better to leave the tiny hatchling wondering what happened than wait for their bond to disintegrate as well.

[color=black]Now convinced she could live nowhere but Plague, Altostratus returned to Viral Evolution with her head bowed. She settled in just in time to watch the clan unravel. When only the founders and [/color][url=http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&id=138250&tab=dragon&did=12788530]the one imperial ally[/url][color=black] remained, Altostratus bid them farewell, keenly aware that her debt could never be repaid.

Rumor has it that those who enter the Tangled Wood do not emerge. Not a day after throwing herself into the fray, Altostratus encountered a beastclan in dire need of assistance. The gears of herosim began to turn once more - and then someone threw a wrench into the generator and everything exploded. Alsotratus is neither sure what went wrong nor how she survived, though she has hazy memories of meeting the founder couple again and watching the beastclan's demise. Exactly what she did during these events has been lost to the brambles.

But at the end of it all, Altostratus remained alone.

[center]-----[/center]

Old grudges die hard, guilt dies harder, and Altostratus has murdered them both. The shimmering skydancer has never been a fighter, but whether she's an unsung hero or a terror to behold depends on who one asks. Her loyalties have been torn throughout central Sornieth, and her whereabouts today remain unknown.

Solar Magistar-McNubs, affable storyteller

[item=Glow Star][/center]

One night it occurred to Solar that dragons could theoretically live forever.  The realization struck him so profoundly that he decided to do the dragon equivalent of sticking one's head in the fridge, stare into the frigid abyss, and ponder the meaning of life - he set out to retrieve a snack from the Southern Icefield. Specifically, he sought out a Glow Star, a rare species of seafood that his peers had been researching.

Instead, Solar wound up in the Scarred Wasteland and witnessed the foundation, growth, and demise of the clan Viral Evolution. During his stay, he honed his battle prowess (though avoided putting it to use whenever possible), swapped stories, and gained the nickname Weenie McNubs. When it became clear that the clan was not meant to last, Solar continued his travels.

Before brilliantly subjecting himself to the unforgiving cold, Solar happened to find a small patch of Glowing Stars in the waters between Plague and Ice. He followed a sparse trail of stars all the way to the Tangled Wood, where he decided to test firsthand if it's truly possible to get lost for an eternity when dragons never die. Surely this would be no problem, since he is truly a scholar and has an excellent sense of direction.

He's vaguely aware of some type of reaping that followed some of his old friends into the fray. Though still lost, Solar has still managed not to die or succumb to evil forces. When he caught word of the Plague clan founders leaving together, he decided to follow so he can hear for himself exactly what happened.

However, he is a silly coatl who does silly things, and it seemed fitting.

Both birdskulls are mementos of his time with Viral Evolution.

# Pestilence

[center][color=#850012](art goes here)

[color=#850012]A lone scientist with an affinity for toxin. Not the gene kind, but he'll do that too.

Don't worry, he only experiments on himself. Everyone else's skin is safe. Mostly.[/center]

[color=#850012]One of [b][color=#1d2224]Pestilence Leechthorn's[/color][/b]'s earliest memories is scraping together a pile of sludge, throwing it at a rock, and watching the mineral erode. It was at that moment his mother, a lone [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDAqLKezfHmqiVWQwGy2YRLUMhYY0NtVwjkIRb_XqAU/mobilebasic]parasite[/url][color=#850012], decided to throw herself into the Wyrmwound at the next opportunity. Or so Pestilence assumes, as he got precious little chance to know her. Instead the spiral was raised by the chaos of a clan on the verge of extinction.

In a desperate bid for acceptance, Pestilence changed his species to something resembling a mirror, the clan's dominant breed (and, supposedly, that of his father). The physical transformation hurt; subsequent rejection moreso. What hatchling in their right mind would spy on other clans for a breed change? Things were tense enough without some youth's meddling, thank you.

But for once, Pestilence had done something right. And here and there, dragons noticed. A blessed few souls asked him for assistance with similar modifications, morphing their patterns or bodies with just the right mix of brewery and magic. It only stung a little.

Around this time, the self-proclaimed scientist found a friend in [url=http://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/14133744]fellow outcast Apocrypha[/url][color=#850012]. Neither bore much loyalty for the clan of their upbringing. When Apocrypha announced his leave in favor of [url=http://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/16213216]the conquests of fiery empress Vulcan[/url][color=#850012], Pestilence followed.

Though both mirrors were lured by a chance at usefulness, only Apocrypha found a sense of belonging among the army. Pestilence instead honed his craft using substances procured throughout Sornieth. Vulcan urged him to make them lethal. He did not protest. His work continued in silence.

At some point during their wanderings through the Tangled Wood, this group too fell apart. Apocrypha thereafter devoted his life to the Plaguebringer, but Pestilence had no such motivation. What was the point of giving your days to a thankless god? They left on a sour note.

Instead Pestilence turned his focus to the bogsneak mutagen, a recent discovery at the time. With the new surname [b][color=#1d2224]Brewspar[/color][/b] and renewed determination, Pestilence refocused his studies to the art of how to modify a dragon without killing them slowly. Though he successfully changed his breed once again, something went... awry.

Pestilence keeps himself isolated as ever nowadays. His mouth won't close right. Countless concoctions stain his claws. Growths both fungal and infectious break through his skin. Four irregular eyes betray his mixed origins, always open, always watching.

He does not rest. He never has.

Schism is trying her best. One of eleven imperials lured by Cumulonimbus' plot to raise an Emperor, Schism is largely responsible for rushing the conflict's escalation; whether or not this was intentional is a mystery to all, but she remained loyal to the clan of Viral Evolution in the end. From then on, she served as a scout as the clan searched for a new home. She also trained many an exaltee since the other trainers, Azurite and Rook, were... occupied, to say the least, reeling from Cumulonimbus' betrayal.

And then the clan unraveled. As former members went their separate ways, up to and eventually including the clan's founders themselves, Schism lingered in the area. [i]Someone[/i] had to help train the exaltees who were under the impression that the clan remained. At some point she also ended up part of a traveling group of oddballs, consisting of herself, a tundra-turned-bumblefae, two colorful spirals, and an ice mirror. They're not a clan and frequently travel separately, but they stay in touch.

Rumor has it that some of Viral Evolution's members have reached the Tangled Wood. Schism has decided to investigate for herself.

But no matter! She's perfectly content looking through green-tinted lenses forever.[/center]


[color=#564d48][b]Drosera Dendron[/b][/color][color=#425035] leads, as far as she's concerned, an unfortunate life. It all started when she hatched. Greenskeeper Gathering preparations were abundant, and she grew up surrounded by the fullest extent of her flight's splendor. Upon growing, Drosera wasted no time exploring less bountiful territories as a light representative. But where did this get her? The middle of the Scarred Wasteland.

It's been ages since Drosera lived with Viral Evolution - if one could call forced containment [i]living[/i]. The small Plague clan's medic demanded she linger months past schedule, just to ensure she wouldn't carry anything contagious back to the Labyrinth. A flimsy excuse! What, were they trying to teach her her a life lesson about how [i]some[/i] Plague clans are more than festering hives of filth? Because if they were... well. They succeeded. But she's not happy about it.

Besides, whether she likes it or not, Drosera's visit has been permanently marked by a pair of goggles. At first the lenses were a gift from a friendly passerby, offered to keep spores from her sockets. Then they became a nuisance, when Drosera tried in vain to claw them off. A dragon can only make a fool of herself so many times; the incident prompted her to keep them on out of spite. But of greater concern nowadays is how the strap presses snugly in the back of her skull.
[columns][color=#425035]Her troubles don't end there, either! Oh, no, she just [i]had[/i] to fall for a [url=http://www1.flightrising.com/dressing/outfit/56527]mystical spirit[/url]*, a dragon who seemed bent on turning Drosera into a walking fable. In this story, there was a prideful mirror who wandered the Labyrinth alone. A skydancer offered her companionship, but received little in return. How, the skydancer wondered, did the mirror intend to spread Nature's glory without straying from the Labyrinth? How could the mirror hiss and spit about other flights, knowing full well the skydancer hailed from the Windswept Plateau?

One day, the skydancer said, "I want only to see you happy, but despite my best efforts, nothing pleases you. So I have a final suggestion. Either accept me as I am, and we can travel the world together. Or deny my feelings, and I will cultivate within your veins a seed so poignant you will be one with the Shrieking Wilds forever."

Although conflicted, the mirror replied, "Nothing would please me more than embodying my flight in any way I can. With thanks for your presence, I choose the latter."

The skydancer, heartbroken, cast her spell and disappeared forever.[nextcol][url=http://fav.me/db15lwl][img]http://t13.deviantart.net/CxKuAFb9uLcGj4trzgVu32z7oO0=/fit-in/700x350/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre11/5178/th/pre/i/2017/063/9/0/a_rep_headshot__d__by_runicfoxy-db15lwl.png[/img][/url][/columns]
[color=#425035]This story, as far as Drosera cares, is a load of putrid brainrot. And even if it [i]was[/i] true, surely anyone could understand the mirror's plight, given such an ultanium?

Regardless, Drosera has not been the same since. As if the departure awakened a dormant disease, her face has finally begun to crack. Patches of bark mar her skin, and from these burst forth creeping tendrils. The growths might be mistaken for an infection. Sometimes Drosera wonders how much of [i]her[/i] is truly left.

Or at least she would, if Nature was an infection! No, no, silly, this is nothing more than a parting blessing, she's certain. Never mind [i]others[/i] with their vials and their flowering eyes, no, Drosera bears the fruits of her flight feverity with her head high. They must envy [i]her[/i] instead, for who could ever regret being reduced to foliage alive.

A flighty little fellow, Fern left her parents' clan in the Shifting Expanse along with her brother Kaguya. Though Kaguya took a path of exaltation under Plaguebringer, Fern continues venturing Sornieth. The thought of staying in one place for too long horrifies her, and he moves almost as much as she talks.

Out of some weird sentimentality, Fern tends to linger near the Scarred Wasteland. Here she befriended the bumblefaes, a duo and later quintet of striped faes with a knack for trouble. Four of the bumblefaes later left to serve Plaguebringer, and Fern was entrusted with one of their familiars. Fern, however, does not have time for familiars. Once she spent some time observing octoflyer around the seas where Water, Wind, and Plague territories converged, and another time she accidentally ruined a harpy's nest in Dragonhome, but that's all.

Fortunately, before she figured out how to kindly tell the bumble to buzz off for good, she met a stray spiral hatchling and gifted the insect to him. He was so impressed by the gift that he begged to travel with Fern, to which she replied that anyone who could keep up was more than welcome to stay with her. They haven't separated since.

During the duo's travels, they briefly joined some other wandering dragons - a scout from a clan related to the bumblefaes, the fifth bumblefae, and an ice miror - but the group didn't last. They stay in touch via written letter, a skill Fern taught them all. (She originally taught herself to write, and at her mother's recommendation, she took lessons to improve legibility. If she had the patience, she might have refined script. However, it tends to look like basilisk scratch because patience is a thing Fern does not have.)

Fern has yet to visit the Tangled Wood or the Viridian Labyrinth. Both seem miserably claustrophobic.


[right]Fern's earrings are a gift from her parents. She found her scarf on her travels and was delighted by how well the colors matched her; at this point, it's seen better days, but she's too used to having something around her neck to let go of it.[/right]


[sub]please name this lil alien if exalting
1\20 with this color, all exalted except 4, 3 on dead accounts[/sub]
[right][sub]^description by previous owner, I was originally gonna exalt but what a good color scheme + "lil alien" got me.
As of March 13, 2016, Fern is 1 of 30 dragons with Green/Blue/Caribbean and 1 of 6 unexalted. 3 have no energy.

If the Dragon Census (as of August 17, 2015) is anything to go by, the average female Spiral has length/wingspan/weight measurements of 3.13M, 2.25M, and 76.77KG (respectively). Fern here is 2.11M, 2M, and 58.46KG. smol spiral

I didn't exalt Kaguya (#13567781); his servitude under Plaguebringer is a coincidence that I incorporated into Fern's lore nonetheless.
