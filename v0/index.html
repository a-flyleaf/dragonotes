  pages scrounged up from tumblr & glitch.me, in various states of completion. Other than fixing some old and/or broken links, they've been copied here exactly as made.

    layout template that rips off the site's default theme. "No funeral for Jimmy" was an inside joke, for reasons I've since forgotten.

    actual clan lore! For reasons unknown I also have the dates 7/10 and 8/27 jotted down. Page updates?

    Not so much an HTML page as a textdump-backup of pages I used to have on my first blog. Behold, an early attempt to meticulously record every. single. thing. that happened in my lair in the early days...!

    revisiting that roster page but with dragon profiles.

    apparently made this on my birthday; HBD past!me??? Putting that dragon-profile page into practice with some lore lizards, all of whom got exalted during an early (if not my first?) lair purge.
    
    fun fact: ``items.kanojo.de`` was the Game&nbsp;Database before the Game&nbsp;Database, a user-made collection of every single item in existence---including a super nifty apparel & accent previewer, which is how I was able to put together images of dragons wearing stuff that they never had onsite. Somewhere along the line it broke! I've replaced a small handful of links with the official database where possible, but there's a few that I just can't track down.<!--well tbh I just didn't feel like it. but maybe later.--> 404 errors it must be. RIP kanojo.

    intended to be a dream dragon scry hoard. Only Zero is here. I have long since exalted the fodder breeder scries used to be saved on. But, fast-forward [five years](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/85045601)...

    Flight Rising official site design ripoff... 2!!

    Also not an HTML page, just a bunch of old bios saved to a text file. Not sure when I actually wrote them, but 11/09 is when the file on my machine was last modified.

    I really wanted to make my own version of [an old dragon size visualizer](https://emcall.github.io/dragonsizes/). I never got around to finishing my own version of a dragon size visualizer. JavaScript is hard.
