                    <div class="description">Caduceus was separated from eir birth clan for unknown reasons when ey was very young. Ey found companionship and a survival partner in another stray, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=14133744">Apocrypha</a>, and the duo traveled together for some time before settling in with Viral Evolution. Though they happened to find the clan in the aftermath of the Incident, which led to a lukewarm welcome, Caduceus soon latched on to <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11943858">Cristofori</a> and began training with him as a healer.<br><br>Ideally, Caduceus and Cristofori would combine their natural Arcane and Plague abilities to become a devastating duo of mages, but such was not meant to be. Cristofori's dissatisfaction with the clan was all too apparent to his trainee. When he declared eir training complete and left VE, Caduceus wasn't surprised. Ey was nonetheless certain of eir future in the clan and looked forward to the day someone would ask for eir own guidance.<br><br>That day never came. Instead, along came <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=16213216">Vulcan</a>, who presented several of the clan's outcasts with promises of glory - if, of course, they joined the coatl's growing army. Caduceus rejected the offer immediately. Why would a mage want to join someone bent on war? Besides, Viral Evolution has become eir home; ey promised ey would serve in Cristofori's place.<br><br>Apocrypha, however, was convinced. Zir parting words seemed to be directed at Caduceus emself - why would anyone stay in a clan where they never belonged? Ze left with a scathing remark - "You can get devoured by the Shade for all I care. You're just denying the truth."<br><br>This apparent betrayal from a dragon Caduceus regarded as a close friend, even a sibling, echoed in eir head for days on end. Hadn't Apocrypha sworn allegiance to the clan that took them in? Why couldn't ze understand that Vulcan's promises were empty? Or were zir words ringing true, and this continued denial was what truly plagued Caduceus' thoughts? Ey tried to confide in a good friend of Apocrypha's, the quirky scientist <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13483458">Pestilence</a>, but found that xe was too caught up in xyr experiments to listen.<br><br>After stress over the conflict robbed em of too many days' rest, Caduceus told Pestilence that ey would be leaving to serve Plaguebringer Herself, then left the clan without any semblance of a goodbye. However, after a long rest, ey changed eir mind. Ey had no idea what "serving Plaguebringer" actually entailed, anyway.<br><br>Unfortunately, ey had traveled too far from Viral Evolution to return - not that ey really wanted to - and lacked a backup plan. Caduceus hasn't been heard from since, however; it can be assumed ey eventually died due to eir inability to survive alone in the Scarred Wasteland.</div>

                    <div class="description">Rook hatched in a land where the color red was almost as rare as an eleven-headed imperial, then was raised by dragons with eyes redder than the sun's final moments. While it can't recall why or how it was separated from its birth clan, it has no doubts about the group of Plague tundras and mirrors who ensured its survival. It may have a few doubts about whether or not this was for the better.<br><br>Raised under the watchful guidance of "Flashpoint," a coalition of Plague dragons, Rook believed it would someday leave their ranks and seek glory for the Filthy One. It saw many a dragon come and go, relentlessly beaten by Flashpoint's finest - a test of survival. Those who survived would be trained as exaltees, warriors for Plaguebringer's ever-expanding army. Those who perished... well, the Southern Icefield wasn't generous with meat.<br><br>On the brink of adulthood, Rook begged its superiors to train it in the arts of war. Instead, it received scorn. An <i>Ice</i> dragon? Wanting to serve <i>Mother Dearest</i>?! How silly. Hadn't it noticed that only Plague dragons lived long enough to embark on the journey to the Wyrmwound? No, Plaguebringer didn't want such fragile creatures. In fact, Rook would have been dead as a hatchling had Flashpoint not deemed it a waste to kill off such a big, strong youth.<br><br>Rook berated itself for not noticing such an obvious pitfall. However, Flashpoint reassured it that it would instead join their ranks and train many a dragon. Testing exaltees was a most honorable task, after all, just second to serving Plaguebringer oneself. And if Rook truly hoped to be of use, it would have no reluctance proceeding with the trials.<br><br>Alas, such was not meant to be. Rook could not bring itself to kill a single dragon, not when their only crime was the possession of non-red eyes. Rather than face Flashpoint's disappointment, Rook fled.<br><br><center><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/5aeaa1430bddc9a99ac73d42166aaea8/tumblr_inline_o0idinF7Yz1qg2i5p_540.png"></center><br>Rook initially attempted to start over. Wander new lands, meet new faces. Put the past behind it. Fate had other plans - it found itself not disgusted by but drawn to relics of its past.<br><br>It soon learned that the deities accepted dragons of any heritage among their ranks, and exaltees were not necessarily warriors. Furthermore, their training was often based not on "survival of the fittest" but on "hone your strengths."<br><br>Its vigor renewed, Rook enlisted in an exaltee training program in the Scarred Wasteland - but despite holding no ill will towards the clan responsible, it ultimately quit. Doubt gnawed at its enthusiasm. It was, after all, an Ice dragon, and an exceptionally strong Ice dragon - surely its abilities were best put to use training others, especially now that it understood how devoid of brutality an exaltee service could be.<br><br>Eventually, Rook came upon an aimless little group. At this point, Viral Evolution treaded the line between extended family and clan. Rook recognized a fighting spirit among the dragons, particularly the fellow young adult <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?ddragon=12140008">Azurite</a>. Without hesitation, Rook threw itself into the fray, eager to spread stories of Plaguebringer's glory.<br><br>Though Rook was received with wariness at first, the clan soon realized that it meant no harm. Its stories were adored, especially by Azurite and her siblings, and Rook had no qualms proposing that the clan establish itself as an exaltee training service. Or, better yet, Rook and Azurite would train new warriors, then leave together to serve Plaguebringer personally - Rook felt as if its insecurities would be soothed if it set off with another (non-Plague) exaltee.<br><br>The clan's founder and Azurite's parent, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116084">Maelstrom</a>, didn't protest to Rook's exalting idea, but they were less than keen on its and Azurite's frequent outings. As a protective measure, they ordered the clan's oldest dragon, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=6594794">Solar</a>, to join them whenever possible. Thus, Rook, Azurite, and Solar became the clan's best fighters by virtue of being together a lot.<br><br>By the time the clan started accepting and seeing off a steady stream of exaltees, Rook no longer had any desire to leave. At last, it had found home.<br><br><center><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/795b06e114c3c0093de81d50da3f8386/tumblr_inline_njviwjGnlp1qg2i5p.png"></center><br>Before long, Rook and Azurite were the proud parents of <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13063260">Kronos</a>, a chubby youth whose strength they hoped to see surpass theirs. Instead, he caught a mouse during his first trip outside the clan's base. Though this concerned Rook and Azurite, they realized that there was no point in denying their son's true strength. The sole offspring of two of the clan's strongest warriors became a peacemaker. Rook could not be more proud.<br><br>Things were relatively peaceful until <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11966926">Cumulonimbus</a> decided that ae needed to take drastic measures to prove aer superiority - or whatever ae was trying to accomplish. Rook, upon seeing the needless loss of life resulting from aer scheme, was disgusted to its core. It was reminded of its upbringing - and not in an appealing way. Azurite was also distraught by her mentor's betrayal, and the couple relied on each others' support frequently during and after the ordeal.<br><br>Matters were not helped by the Skydancer's return to the clan. A dragon willing to risk the fate of not only their clan but their entire flight was, in Rook's view, not a dragon worth keeping around. It nonetheless tried to keep its scathing commentary to itself, lest it contribute to Azurite's internal strife.<br><br>When Viral Evolution began to unravel, Rook found itself almost pleased. Not that it hadn't enjoyed its stay a great deal, but the clan no longer felt like home. Instead Rook found itself drawn once more to the one constant in its life, the guiding haze of Mother Dearest. When <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13483458">Pestilence</a> announced that <a href="#Caduceus">Caduceus</a> had left to serve Plaguebringer, Rook could contain its renewed excitement no longer. It asked Azurite once more to leave with it - and this time, because they were both filled with restlessness, she said yes.<br><br>After several goodbyes, some more heartfelt than others, Rook and Azurite (and a good amount of their family, as it turned out) left Viral Evolution. They now serve directly under the Filthy One and could not be more happy.<p align="right"><sub><i>graphic credit to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160105113533/http://www1.flightrising.com/forums/adopt/1362119">osiem</a></i></sub></p></div>

                    <div class="description">Azurite once lived peacefully with a water pack, but after an accident left her unable to keep up with the others, she strayed and ended up in the Scarred Wasteland. Before death could claim her, Azurite was found by a trio - <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116084">Maelstrom</a>, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116085">Lapilli</a>, and <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11966926">Cumulonimbus</a> - who were happy to take her under their wings. She regarded the first two as parents and, when strong enough to fight, began training under Cumulonimbus. Along the way, the group was joined by <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=6594794">Solar</a>, who Azurite playfully dubbed "Weenie McNubs" in honor of his stubby limbs.<br><br>Though no one made Azurite feel like an outcast, she nonetheless felt the need to prove her worth. When Maelstrom and Lapilli's progeny, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280263">Chalcedony</a> and <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280264">Riptide</a>, hatched, Azurite became more determined than ever to ensure that the clan had reason to keep her around. She formed a friendly sibling rivalry with Riptide and attempted to do the same with Chalcedony, though the purple-winged mirror was less than enthusiastic about such a competitive atmosphere.<br><br>With Riptide being a fae, it soon became apparent that Azurite was physically superior. Such was life, and Riptide gave Azurite no trouble for it. The same could not be said of Cumulonimbus, whose internal struggle with pride and envy was all too apparent to Azurite. The once-strong relationship between mentee and mentor began to strain.<br><br>One day, a stranger arrived with stories of Plaguebringer's splendor. It introduced itself as <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11734384">Rook</a> and was delighted by how competitive a majority of the clan's members were. Azurite took a liking to the newcomer, thrilled to have a distraction from her deteriorating relationship with Cumulonimbus, and soon forged a close friendship. Maelstrom ordered Solar to join many of their training missions, and before long, the two mirrors and Solar became the clan's best fighters. Azurite and Rook established an exaltee training program; Rook suggested early on that they join Plaguebringer as well, but both knew they weren't going anywhere by the time the program was under way.<br><br>She and Rook bore one progeny, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13063260">Kronos</a>, who took an affinity not to fighting but to peacemaking. When he learned of Azurite's previous exploits with familiars - a Sakura Owl she caught in an effort to prove herself to the clan, and later a Mantarune she met when it ate the annoying avian - he befriended a mouse. This was initially a cause of deep concern to his parents - how could a dragon unable to kill a mouse possibly survive, let alone when he was of a species who ate primarily meat? Nonetheless, their fears were soothed when it turned out that Kronos was still capable of defending himself and killing to meet his basic needs, he just preferred to interact with words over claws. Azurite was relieved her need to prove her worth, which had been subsiding since she began training exaltees with Rook, had not been passed on to her young.<br><br>By this point, Azurite avoided speaking with Cumulonimbus, fearing that she would reopen old wounds. When they interacted, it was cordial, as if they were strangers who regularly met at the edge of the others' territory. Cumulonimbus never displayed animosity, but Azurite noticed several imperials foregoing training with her and Rook in favor of outings with the skydancer. She interpreted this as the skydancer's attempt to prove aer superiority, even if ae was physically outmatched.<br><br>But even this sting could not compare to what became of it, when the clan confronted Cumulonimbus and aer imperials at the edge of the Wyrmwound. It seemed as though Cumulonimbus was trying to raise an emperor - traitor! Ae protested that ae did not want to use the emperor to attack the clan but rather in defense of it; ae would have control of their greatest weapon. As much as Azurite wanted to believe Cumulonimbus' intentions were good, there was no time for talk. A fight broke out between the clan and power-hungry imperials - and Azurite saw Cumulonimbus flee the scene.<br><br>Viral Evolution won, though to the disgust of some of its members, the imperials perished and their killers were treated as heroes. Rook was appalled and Azurite's view of the situation flipped day to day. The one imperial who remained loyal to the clan, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12788530">Schism</a>, took over exlatee training duties as the two attempted to console each other.<br><br>Azurite, recalling how Maelstrom often left the clan to wander alone until their social burnout subsided, decided to leave for a few days to sort out her thoughts. However, she encountered Cumulonimbus - now named Altostratus - and decided she wouldn't let aer leave without closure. Altostratus apologized deeply for everything ae had done to Azurite (including being present in her life at all, which Azurite insisted didn't warrant an apology), then expressed desire not for forgiveness but for atonement. Azurite guided aer back. Despite having decided moments before their meeting that she and the rest of the clan were better off without Altostratus, Azurite couldn't help but hope that things would go back to how they were - but this time, Altostratus had learned aer lesson, would not accidentally start a rebellion, and all would be well.<br><br>Not so much. The clan was divided on whether or not to welcome Altostratus, though ae was allowed to stay because Viral Evolution was still recovering from the "Imperial Incident" and needed the help that Altostratus was eager to provide. Azurite felt as though she'd made a horrible mistake nonetheless, especially when dragons who she thought had made permanent residence began to leave. When talking about the situation with Rook, she had to admit that Viral Evolution no longer felt like home.<br><br>She found herself dreaming of Plaguebringer's splendor, recalling the stories that Rook brought with it to the clan, and wondering what it would be like to follow the paths of all the exaltees she had trained. When Rook asked if she would like to leave with it to serve the Filthy One, she was almost too eager to say yes.<br><br>Though it pained Azurite to leave her family behind, it turned out that her siblings and Kronos would also be willing to follow them to the Wyrmwound. Maelstrom and Lapilli stayed behind and, while saddened, wished their progeny the best of fortunes on their journey and beyond.<br><br>Azurite, Rook, Riptide, Chalcedony, Kronos, and some striped fae friends of the clan have now devoted the rest of their lives to Plaguebringer and could not be more fulfilled.</div>

                    <div class="description">Riptide and vir sibling <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280263">Chalcedony</a> were born to the clan's founders, Maelstrom and Lapilli. Although big for a fae, Riptide often fantasized about being a mirror instead. Not that ve didn't appreciate Lapilli's guidance, ve couldn't compete (in terms of sheer physical strength) with vir sibling/rival <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?ddragon=12140008">Azurite</a> for long, to both of their disappointment. It just didn't seem fair - Chalcedony was a mirror, and ce didn't want to be intimidating at all.<br><br>Thus, when the siblings went exploring, Riptide took up the habit of terrorizing the local wildlife. Ve learned a great deal about how various creatures responded to fear. Chalcedony preferred to examine the fauna instead of scaring everything away at the first opportunity, which led to some strife, but never enough to drive a permanent wedge between the duo. Fortunately, expeditions got more successful with the addition of <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13063260">Kronos</a>, Azurite's progney, who became a mediator between the siblings.<br><br>However, after some time, the trio suspected they weren't alone.<br><br>It started with missing food - wasn't that pile of minnows bigger when they left it? Riptide argued that any given animal wouldn't have been smart enough to cover up its tracks, though Chalcedony argued that Riptide wasn't giving non-dragon species enough credit.<br><br>But even when Riptide hid the spoils out of reach, something always went missing. It wasn't funny anymore - as if it was ever fun and games to start with. Dragons were constantly coming and going, and with their focus on exaltee training, they had no time to hunt! Riptide began wondering how dragons would react when scared out of their wits. Then Kronos suggested that maybe the thief was starving and couldn't hunt for themselves, but they wouldn't risk showing their face because they were scared. Oh, the irony.<br><br>Riptide, still wanting to see the thief's face, decided ve would start staying behind and watching over the loot while Chalcedony and Kronos gathered. While this stopped thievery for some time, it led to an increase in annoyance for the mirrors - sometimes amber would drip on their faces when they were deeply focused, other times they would trip into pitfalls that hadn't been there before. The trio took turns standing guard - but no matter what, they could not find the trickster. And Riptide was certain the culprit was a trickster, for a starving thief wouldn't waste time with such meaningless pranks.<br><br>One day, Riptide decided to beat the trickster at their own game. Ve hid, out of sight to passerbys but close enough to keep vir eyes on the prize. And what a prize it was - the Wasteland had been generous on that day's expedition - A pile of trinkets, left unguarded but on a path that just any dragon couldn't stumble upon accidentally. The thief was sure to fall for it.<br><br>Riptide waited. And waited. And waited. Just when Chalcedony and Kronos complained that it was long past time to return, Riptide noticed a flash of striped wings nearby. Ve threw virself at the adversary - and latched onto <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13316776">a blue-striped fae</a>. As ve struggled to prevent the thief's escape, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13339894">another fae</a> - this one embarrassingly easy to spot - tried to pry vir off. Chalcedony had to interfere. The striped faes couldn't fight to save their lives, but they could <i>move</i>.<br><br>After a scuffle, the siblings pinned the terrified faes, much to Riptide's satisfaction. The yellow one insisted they meant no harm, but the trio knew otherwise. However, they had no desire to kill and were certain that the faes would now learn their lesson, so they let the two troublemakers go. During the trek back to the clan, Riptide lamented that ve would have loved to play with them longer; ve was only half-joking.<br><br>Surprisingly, the opportunity presented itself like an exaltee before their deity. Riptide soon noticed that ve was being watched - and just vir alone, not so much the mirrors. Knowing ve could best the trickster in a fight if it came to that, ve flew off out of Chalcedony and Kronos' detection, then called out to the other. Who were they? What would it take for them to leave?<br><br>The blue fae, while apparently shaken from their first meeting, introduced himself. His name was Indil, and he and his brother Sonnuk were indeed trying to make trouble. After that last fight, they were going to leave without looking back - but Indil wanted to know what a fae was doing with a couple of mirrors. He thought ve might be staying with them for protection, but as proven by this one-on-one meeting, ve wasn't scared at all.<br><br>Riptide, who had expected a fight, was stunned by Indil's bravery - or perhaps foolishness. Regardless, ve barely had a chance to respond before Sonnuk showed up. Sonnuk, either ignoring or unaware of Riptide's presence, launched into a rant loud enough to attract Chalcedony and Kronos. Sonnuk noticed this, but continued arguing because Indil would not leave. Riptide explained the situation to vir baffled companions, and long before the brothers could stop arguing, the trio decided they would invite the faes to the clan. It would be presented as a peace offering - but the real reason was to present the troublemakers to Maelstrom and Lapilli so they could decide how to handle the situation once and for all.<br><br>The faes, who were too busy yelling at each other to pay attention to the trio's scheming, were shocked silent when Riptide asked if they wanted a tour of the clan. Indil immediately agreed, and an exasperated Sonnuk joined in. Once again, Riptide imagined how they'd respond when they were banished from any interaction, direct or otherwise, with Viral Evolution - and should they disobey the order, results could be deadly.<br><br>Ve overestimated Maelstrom's ability to care. It was obvious that the faes posed no real threat to the clan, and apparently they didn't have a home either. They were allowed to stay near Viral Evolution if and <i>only</i> if they promised to stop causing a ruckus.<br><br>Surprisingly, this worked out save the rare encounter where the faes didn't realize they were antagonizing a clan member. Riptide continued meeting Indil - sometimes with others, sometimes without - and they forged some kind of friendship-rivalry-hatred-thing. Certainly not as clear-cut as Riptide's rivalry with Azurite. No one could make sense of it, Riptide and Indil included. The faes never joined the clan officially, but they were considered some kind of allies. Not that they contributed much.<br><br>Some time later, Riptide learned from a distressed Indil that someone within the clan was plotting against everyone else. Ve immediately passed the news on to Maelstrom and Lapilli, who decided not to speak of it until they had more information even though Riptide insisted that Indil was no liar - but one thing led to another, and thus sparked the confrontation of a lifetime.<br><br>Long story short, the faes - Sonnuk, Indil, and <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13503730">two</a> <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13187547">others</a> who had joined their little colony - saved Viral Evolution and perhaps all of Sornieth. Riptide, for one, couldn't believe that these weaklings had prevented the rise of an emperor, and suddenly felt not only satisfied but proud to be a fae.<br><br>But their victory was not without controversy, and after several ongoing tensions reached a breaking point, Viral Evolution began to divide. Riptide had started to find life boring after such an event, and when Azurite decided she was leaving to serve Plaguebringer, Riptide declared ve wouldn't let vir rival get away <i>that</i> easily. They were joined by Chalceony and Kronos, and during the process of goodbyes, the bee faes tagged along.<br><br>While Riptide occasionally misses Viral Evolution, ve is having the time of vir life contributing to Plague's expanding knowledge of how creatures - draconic and otherwise - respond to crisis.<br><br><center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150720012053/https://frtaurelia.tumblr.com/post/114205746535/i-made-some-horizontal-flight-banners-too-these"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/e3746a35ab84eb6224e6c051d27ba2d6/tumblr_nlk2qk9u0l1sz016vo5_500.png"></a></center><br>By the time Riptide left to serve Plaguebringer, ve had added eye spots to vir wings thanks to <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13483458">Pestilence</a>.

However, ve rejected the offer to turn into a mirror.</div>

                    <div class="description">Chalcedony and cir sibling <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280264">Riptide</a> were born to the clan's founders, Maelstrom and Lapilli. Unlike Riptide and vir rival <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12140008">Azurite</a>, Chalcedony would rather dive headfirst into an uncharted abyss than fight for fun. Ce kept to cirself growing up, though ce was never afraid to take jabs at Riptide's antics. While not necessarily always in good fun, the siblings managed to not kill each other and overall remain close.<br><br>While Chalcedony could stand to look less intimidating, ce enjoyed the size advantage when embarking on gathering expeditions with Riptide. The added stamina helped cir get ahead to examine the wildlife and form a mental map of the area before Riptide inevitably caused a ruckus (usually). Such outings became less chaotic with the addition of Azurite's offspring <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13063260">Kronos</a>, who didn't just fight with words over claws - he preferred to forego fighting altogether.<br><br>Cue the interference of a troublemaker. At first Chalcedony argued that some local animal could be stealing their food - after all, non-draconic species seemed wiser than anyone suspected - but the thief could not be deterred by even the most clever of hiding places. Kronos suggested a kinder view of the thief as a starving wanderer, which Chalcedony agreed with... until ce and Kronos began stumbling into pitfalls and tripping over roots that had been buried just a moment ago. Cir patience for such antics steadily decreased.<br><br>One day, Riptide suggested the trio stay back and leave their spoils "unguarded" in hopes of trapping the thief. Chalcedony grew weary of staying in one spot and wanted to move along long before Riptide's patience waned. Only Kronos kept them together, but even he succumbed to boredom eventually. But just as Chalcedony and Kronos turned to leave, Riptide made an attack. Then another dragon joined the fray, prompting Chalcedony to interfere - and before long, the siblings had <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13339894">two</a> <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13316776">faes</a> at their mercy.<br><br>While Riptide hoped to toy with the troublemakers, Chalcedony's tolerance had run dry. Ce barely managed to keep cir attacks verbal. Fortunately, Kronos insisted that the faes had learned their lesson and should be let go, and the siblings obliged before Chalcedony did something ce might regret.<br><br>Shaken by cir behavior when pushed to the limits of cir tolerance, Chalcedony opted to stay away from the faes, even when Riptide's plan led to an uneasy alliance between them and the rest of the clan. Instead, ce kept to cirself as usual.<br><br>As the clan grew and continued traveling in search of a permanent residence, Chalcedony's excellent memory of the landscape came in handy. Ce and Kronos would often run ahead to examine the area, with Kronos handling run-ins with other clans; their preference for peace helped Viral Evolution out of many a conflict before it could start.<br><br>Unfortunately, inter-clan conflict came to a boiling point. The entre incident left Chalcedony baffled; who were cir friends and foes now? Ce had never been good at detecting how dragons truly felt about each other - something Kronos exceeded at, but he seemed preoccupied with his own worries so Chalcedony opted not to ask. All ce knew was that ce suddenly felt out of place, and all the uncharted territory in the Scarred Wasteland beckoned cir more than ever. Yet the clan was in no position to uproot again.<br><br>Wanderlust shook Chalcedony to the core when clan members - those who once thought they'd live with Viral Evolution to the end of their days, not exaltees - began leaving. When Azurite decided she and her mate <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=11734384">Rook</a> were off to serve Plaguebringer, Riptide tagged along, and Chalcedony didn't see why ce shouldn't leave as well. No one said they had to be warriors; surely Chalcedony's perfect visual memory would be more useful to someone whose aim was ever-expanding conquest, not a clan that didn't venture into territories where risk outweighed reward. Chalcedony had some hesitance about leaving the remaining clan members, but cir parents reassured cir that ce had to follow the path that beckoned cir most - and if it wasn't this one, they wholeheartedly supported wherever her journeys took cir.<br><br>As it turned out, Kronos' anxieties mainly concerned the division of his family, so he had no hesitation joining the group set to join Plaguebringer. Before long, the bee faes jumped in, and thus formed a small band of dragons set to put their skills to use for none other than the Filthy One herself. Chalcedony ensured that they never got lost - just took a few appealing detours along the way.<br><br>With Plaguebringer's blessing, ce is now trying to see every corner of the Scarred Wasteland for cirself. At last, every day is a new adventure.</div>

                    <div class="description">Kronos' parents, Azurite and Rook, were two of Viral Evolution's three best fighters. He grew up surrounded by stories of their battles, warding off potential enemies and training potential recruits. But none of those tales interested him as much as Azurite's adventures in familiar taming. She first caught a Sakura Owl in an attempt to prove her worth to her new clan, but the owl caused far more trouble than it was worth. During a trip to the Kelp Beds, the owl was eaten by a Mantarune. Azurite, eternally greatful to be rid of the annoying avian, dubbed the sea monster her new familiar, even though she never saw that exact Mantarune again. (Well, probably not. Mantarunes all look the same to the untrained eye.)<br><br>During Kronos' first training session, he befriended a mouse and named it Glowy. At first his parents assumed it was part of a ploy to earn the trust of countless mice, making hunting all the easier. It soon became apparent, however, that he and the mouse were best friends forever. Kronos refused to lay a claw on any fauna unless someone else had ended its life beforehand.<br><br>Despite his parents' concerns, Kronos grew up a peacekeeper. He formed a trio of explorers with Riptide and Chalcedony, who found his presence as a mediator invaluable. Chalcedony in particular appreciated the addition of a dragon who wasn't itching for a fight. Eventually, Rook and Azurite conceded that there was no point in denying their son's true strengths, and their anxities were replaced by pride. Besides, Kronos soon learned that killing for food was an inevitable part of nature; while he would always be irked if he had to perform the deed himself, he got over his aversion to it entirely. To his (and everyone else's) surprise, Glowy never left his side.<br><br>Over time, the explorers noticed they were being watched. Their piles of prey shrank when their backs were turned. Kronos assumed the best and suggested to the increasingly impatient siblings that the thief was starving. Of course the poor thing wouldn't ask for food directly - they had shown nothing but annoyance if not hostility towards the "troublemaker."<br><br>Kronos' sympathy was tested when the thief started planting pitfalls and other traps. Riptide insisted that a starving dragon wouldn't bite the claws that fed them, and even Chalcedony's patience ran low. Kronos was tempted to go on the offense, but ultimately decied against it. He would be helping no one by assuming the worst.<br><br>One day Riptide suggested a plan to catch the thief once and for all. It lasted far longer than Kronos and Chalcedony had the patience for, but Riptide's persistence paid off when she caught <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13316776">a fae</a> - who was soon joined by <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13339894">another</a>, leading to a small scuffle. When the faes were pinned and one insisted they meant no harm, Kronos interfered. They had learned their lesson and there was no point in bloodshed. Even so, he had some parting words for the thieving duo - "Please. If you know what's good for you, stay out of trouble."<br><br>At least one of the faes refused to stay away. When Riptide met him independently, he introduced himself as Indil and explained that he and his brother Sonnuk actually <i>were</i> trying to cause trouble. Sonnuk interfered, loudly, which attracted Kronos and Chalcedony, and before long the explorer trio and the fae duo were talking amongst themselves about what to make of the situation. It was eventually decided that the faes would be offered a tour of the Viral Evolution, less as the peace offering it was presented as and more as an attempt to get them before Maelstrom and Lapilli. Surely the clan's (unofficial) leaders would know exactly what to do. Kronos' prayers for a peaceful resolution were answered when the meeting ended in an uneasy alliance.<br><br>From there, Kronos encountered the faes on occasion, but otherwise resumed his uneventful exploration. When the clan began searching for a permanent residence, he and Chalcedony often ran ahead to scour the land. Neither of them opted for fighting if they encountered other clans, which helped Viral Evolution out of many a potential conflict.<br><br>Inter-clan conflict avoidance was not so simple. In the aftermath of the incident, the clan was divided. Dragons who were assumed to be permanent residents ended up leaving. Some, including Rook, were disgusted by the carnage and ashamed of the events from start to finish. Others, including Riptide, were more inclined towards pride. Opinions on certain dragons were polarized. There seemed no end to the turmoil in a once-peaceful clan, and Kronos had trouble processing it. He feared that he would need to choose sides between the dragons he loved most, and subsequently refused to confess his troubles to anyone. At least he had Glowy, whose loyalties were for him and no one else no matter what.<br><br>Then Rook and Azurite announced their intentions to join Plaguebringer. Riptide and Chalcedony joined them, making Kronos' choice apparent. He would miss his clan, exhausting as it was towards the end, but he would not leave his closest family members behind. The faes joined the group as well, and then they were off.<br><br>Plaguebringer's conquest is hardly a peaceful affair, but there is a time and place for everything. When a diplomatic solution is desired, the mirror and his mouse are on the front lines.</div>

                    <div class="description">Indil cannot recall a single dragon in his early life who isn't <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13339894">Sonnuk</a> or <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13616666">Hecate</a>. The striped fae hatchlings met by the Sea of a Thousand Currents and spent their days surviving... and conniving. Nothing less than trickery ensured the continatuion of their lives, and they were delighted by the trouble they caused in the process.<br><br>As far as Indil knew, there were two steps to a perfect scheme: successful setup and a carefully-chosen audience. Both required keen observation and the occasional intervention, both of which Indil was more than happy to provide. The world was full of secrets waiting to be exploited for fun and profit. Other dragons proved difficult to read with certainty, but Indil found that they could be roughly divided into two groups: those who could take a joke and those who could not. Prank the wrong dragons and trouble would befall the bee faes. But if they chose the right victim, they could not only witness a beautifully-executed ploy, they could receive a bonus from a kind-hearted soul who took pity on the stray little things.<br><br>Thus the trio whipped up a perfect storm for any pitiable passerby without getting themselves targeted or killed or mocked in the process. However, the joke was on them; when Hecate started toying with magic and Sonnuk made no secret of his distaste, Hecate left and Sonnuk decided it was time to stay in the land of <i>his</i> hatching. Though Indil wondered how much Sonnuk had thought this through, he wasn't about to let his only other friend go off alone, too.<br><br><center><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/732327097b5071d006a0397e2a3c992e/tumblr_nj9kyb0AiI1r28672o10_540.png"></center><br>The Scarred Wasteland proved more challenging than the blue fae's aquatic domain. Before long, Indil noticed non-Plague dragons falling ill if they ventured too deep into the Wandering Contagion, and he suspected he would have succumbed as well had he not grown up with Sonnuk. Something about that intrigued Indil; he'd never been so excited to explore a region, even if it seemed devoid of life.<br><br>Sonnuk was also thrilled, but for different reasons - easier to take advantage of sick dragons, right? Indil agreed - but wouldn't it be more fun to challenge those who were in perfect shape? Fortunately, Sonnuk never questioned his suggestion of the more life-threatening option; Indil wasn't about to reveal he was invested in their victims beyond what they could do for the faes.<br><br>Notably, Sonnuk and Indil set their target on three dragons - two mirrors, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280263">Chalcedony</a> and <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13063260">Kronos</a>, and <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12280264">one fae</a>. Indil was intrigued. He expected the fae would be staying with the mirrors for protection, but he never noticed a hint of fear. Then again, Sonnuk wouldn't let him "creep" on them any longer than necessary.<br><br>The Plague trio started catching on. After a while, Sonnuk and Indil overheard them deciding that one of them would guard their spoils while the other two continued the gathering expedition. The faes turned their attention on the gatherers, swapping thievery for pranks; they had a surplus of stolen spoils.<br><br>Nonetheless, Indil kept lingering while Sonnuk flew ahead with the mirrors. The <i>fae</i> was standing guard? Were the mirrors cruelly leaving the most defenseless of their trio behind? Indil and Sonnuk had targeted these three because the mirrors seemed unusually likely to take pity on them. It didn't make sense. But he never got a good enough look at the fae to tell for certain.<br><br>Indil got his answer when he stumbled upon a beautiful pile of trinkets fresh for the taking. With his thoughts preoccupied by trivial musings, he never considered he was being watched and advanced without hesitation. Immediately he was attacked, his escape prevented by claws and wings just as small as yet more nimble than his. Sonnuk joined the fray, prompting Chalcedony to intervene, and soon the tricksters became the tricked as they were pinned by their skilled adversaries. Fortunately, when Sonnuk insisted they meant no harm, Kronos finally intervened to advocate for the faes' release. He didn't seem to buy Sonnuk's story, however; he left them with a warning to stay out of trouble.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, Sonnuk declared their time in the Scarred Wasteland over. Yet Indil resisted. They still had a surplus of food and it would be a shame to let it all rot. The appeal worked like a charm, giving Indil a chance to continue watching the Plague dragon - just one. The fae. Indil could not have been more wrong; Riptide was not afraid.<br><br>To Indil's delight, Riptide seemed to notice his continued presence. One day, ve left the trio and specifically called out to him, wondering who he was and when he would leave. Though still shaken from their previous encounter, Indil introduced himself. He saw no point in lying about his and Sonnuk's intentions, since they would be leaving the Wasteland shortly. But he had questions of his own first.<br><br>Enter Sonnuk. He just wanted Indil to leave, right then, immediately, but Indil retorted that the idea never appealed to him in the first place. Before the argument could escalate, however, Riptide put virself between them and suggested they hav a tour of the trio's clan. This stunned the faes into silence. Indil spoke first - they'd love to. He'd never been more intrigued.<br><br><center><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/aed6377eb396abbaa7338900db5baea2/tumblr_nj9kyb0AiI1r28672o9_540.png"></center><br>The duo was presented to the clan's leaders, who decided they were not a threat and allowed them to linger in the territory, but only if they stopped causing the clan any trouble. Agreement on these terms was mutual.<br><br>Though the one visit was enough for Indil to decide he'd never be satisfied living in such a group, what with its unspoken rules and social norms, he had no qualms staying in Viral Evolution's vicinity. He met Riptide frequently and they formed a complicated semi-platonic-love-rivalry-friendship-hatred-thing that no one could figure out (themelves included).<br><br>Meanwhile, Sonnuk "recruited" two striped faes, <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13503730">Vayne</a> and <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=13187547">Ada</a>, to join his antics. Vayne proved an invaluable asset to their schemes due to her penchant for strategy, while Ada held the four together whenever rifts arose. Everyone was happy - or so it seemed.<br><br>And then the faes picked up on a plot to create an Emperor and everything went to the Wyrmwound, iterally. Indil was deeply distraught by the events, and from then on the faes were more careful than ever about only looking at whether or not a dragon was useful to them. Fortunately, they never lost their sense of fun, and harmless pranks continued. They didn't need to steal anymore, really; the clan's opinions of their exploits were divided, but at least the dragons with authority liked them enough to provide food and shelter when they asked.<br><br>Still, Viral Evolution divided in more than opinion. Indil soon learned that Riptide was going to leave to serve Plaguebringer, along with most of vir family. When he relayed this to Sonnuk, Sonnuk suggested a final uprooting - he'd leave to join Plaguebringer, too, if Indil wanted. The proposition shocked Indil; wouldn't they have more fun exploring the rest of Sornieth? But technically, no one said they <i>couldn't</i> keep tormenting dragons worldwide, they'd just be under Plaguebringer's guidance. They might have to lie about their intentions a little, but what else was new? The important thing was that they stuck together. And Indil agreed - if only so Sonnuk would never live down that moment of sappiness.<br><br>Thus the bee faes, emperor slayers, joined the ranks of Plaguebringer Herself. Indil's perceptive nature and sense of humor is appreciated by many a dragon, though he spends most of his time ensuring that even exaltees are not protected from pranks.<p align="right"><sub><i>graphic credit to <a href="http://ammoth.tumblr.com/post/110092763801">ammoth</a></i></sub></p></div>
