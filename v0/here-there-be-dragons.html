        My dragons were <i>supposed</i> to be an army of awesome hardcore zombie warriors. Instead, they formed a vaguely-organized group of nerds. I'm not really sure how that happened.</p>
    <p>Right now the dragons are split into two major groups: the main clan, Viral Evolution, and a quartet of bee Faes. A few dragons outside these groups also have lore, because I buy too many dragons that I can't let go of. <b>I'm willing to roleplay with any of these dragons!</b></p>
    <p>Maybe one of these days I'll make a whole series of pages about these dragons and their stories and it'll be my own lore encyclopedia. That day is a long time coming, but in the mean time if there's anything you're curious about, you're more than welcome to ask!</p>

    <center><h1>Viral Evolution</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>A ragtag family, not necessarily related by blood but nonetheless close, Viral Evolution prides itself on adaptability over brute force.</p>
            <p>VE specializes in training exaltees, though any dragon who is willing to change and grow is welcomed. However, certain events have made them hesitant to allow just any newcomer into their permanent ranks.</p>
            <p>To outsiders, they may appear standoffish, even virulent. Exaltees arive, train, and leave, with no frivolous affairs surrounding their stay. Those within the clan know better, as they are treated to a culture of communication and acceptance. (For the most part.)</p>
            <p>Currently, the clan wanders the Abiding Boneyard in search of a place to call home, since their original land proved inadequate. Whether or not they will remain nomadic or establish new territory has yet to be determined. No matter what, they move on.</p></div>

    <div class="sideprofile" id="Maelstrom"><a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116084"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lFd4qsf.png" class="profilepic"></a><br><a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116084" class="name">Maelstrom</a><br><sub><i>The Reluctant Founder</i><br><sub>(he/they, interchangeable)</sub></sub></div>
    <div class="mainprofile">
        <p>A simple dragon with simple needs, Maelstrom never intended to found a clan. Intracommunity tensions led to a boil in their former pack, so he left in an attempt to live alone. However, he vastly overestimated his self-sufficiency. Had they been left to their own devices permanently they likely wouldn't have survived for long.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, help arrived in the form of a Fae named Lapilli. A lone wanderer from a shattered colony, she decided she'd stick around to help Maelstrom settle down properly. Though he found this condescending, he couldn't protest. Eventually the duo decided they wouldn't mind staying together, just for a bit longer....</p>
        <p>Today, Maelstrom and Lapilli are the proud parents of three, as well as the unofficial leaders of the clan. Maelstrom is now surrounded by dragons he knows he can trust, and he thoroughly enjoy his new life. Nonetheless, socialization never <i>was</i> their specialty, and they occasionally leave for days at a time for the sake of being alone.</p>
        <p>Maelstrom makes little effort at sympathy and compassion; they see no point in faking what they don't experience. Any act of kindness they <i>do</i> display is entirely genuine. They simply don't go out of their way to be hospitable <i>or</i> rude; whatever is, is, and they respect such honesty in other dragons.</p>
        <p>When not on their own or helping the clan with less social activities (notably scavenging), Maelstrom can be found spending time with his partner Lapilli, their progeny, or trying to act like he's not biased.</p>
        <hr>
        <p align="right"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/29YLmEI.png" align="right" class="familiar">Maelstrom's familiar is a Shattered Serpent. They may or may not have killed the serpent's parents during a hunting expedition in the Sandswept Delta; if the serpent is aware of this, it doesn't care. The bone snek has taken a liking to Maelstrom and they enjoy its company.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="profile">
    <div class="sideprofile" id="Lapilli"><a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116085"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wvaiZVm.png" class="profilepic"></a><br><a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?dragon=12116085" class="name">Lapilli</a><br><sub><i>The Zealous Leader</i><br><sub>(she)</sub></sub></div>
    <div class="mainprofile">
        <p>For a small dragon, Lapilli has a big role. After a catastrophic accident in her birth colony forced survivors to flee and disperse, she spent some time on her own. Before long she found a lone Mirror, Maelstrom, who would clearly die if left to their own devices for much longer. She took pity on them and decided to stick around until he could get his lair in order.</p>
        <p>It did not take long for other dragons to join them, either by coincidential travels or hatching into the newfound clan. Lapilli had been in charge since the start, and while the clan lacks an official hierarchy, she's now considered the leader (alongside Maelstrom, though he doesn't interact with those outside his direct family much). She couldn't be happier, since having control is of utmost importance to her.</p>
        <p>Lapilli is mute. She is physically capable of speaking, though words never came easily to her. Depending on who she's around, she may alter her body language for easier reading. It's become more natural to her over time and most dragons in the clan have no problem understanding her. She's willing to compromise with those who have difficulties with this, however.</p>
        <p>If something in the clan is happening, no matter how small, Lapilli probably knows about it. She enjoys organizing dragons into certain roles based on what needs to be done that day. Otherwise Lapilli can be found spending time one-on-one with whoever's up for her company.</p>
        <hr>
        <p align="right"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s2cbbEt.png" align="right" class="familiar">Lapilli's familiar is a Rainbow Sprite - er, Rainbow Sprite<i>s</i>. She found one while fishing, called it Shiny, and decided it would be her Shiny. The original Shiny hasn't been seen since, but this hasn't stopped Lapilli from taking a liking to any shimmering fish that crosses her path.</p>

        <p>Once a self-proclaimed hero, now a self-made outcast. Arrived at the clan with dreams of grandeur and was happy to train Azurite in the arts of hunting and battle, but student soon surpassed teacher. Bitterly orchestrated The Incident - and immediately regretted it. Has since gained forgivenesss (at least from clanmates present at the time), but hasn't quite forgiven self.</p>
        <p>Former mate of Cristofori; parent of three, though all progeny left to serve Plaguebringer (much to Cumulonimbus' delight). Complicated relationship with former mentee Azurite.</p>

        <p>Arrived in the clan as a lost orphan, now an invaluable member. Spent a majority of youth trying to prove worthiness but eventually realized it wasn't necessary. Eager to defend loved ones at all costs nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Adopted by Maelstrom and Lapilli; sibling of Chalcedony and Riptide. Mate of Rook; parent of Kronos. Along with Solar and Rook, part of an inseparable trio of fighters. Complicated relationship with former mentor Cumulonimbus.</p>

        <p>Regarded as an uncle by Azurite and Pestilence (as well as Chalcedony and Riptide, to a lesser extent). Good friends with Cristofori. Along with Azurite and Rook, part of an inseparable trio of fighters.</p>

        <p>The dragon equivalent of a Disney princess, but less singing with woodland creatures and more fascination with the unexplored. Thoroughly rejected competitive atmosphere from youth, would rather dive headfirst into an uncharted abyss than fight for fun. Mental map of territory has come in handy on several occasions.</p>
        <p>Progeny of Maelstrom and Lapilli; sibling of Riptide and Azurite. Acts as a mentor/older sibling to Kronos.</p>

        <p>The dragon equivalent of a rebellious princess, but less pointless weapon-swinging and more enjoyment from terrorizing woodland creatures. Thoroughly enjoyed competitive atmosphere from youth, will forever resent being born a Fae (but not strongly enough to attempt a breed change). Boasts a keen understanding of how others respond to fear.</p>

        <p>If anything good came out of The Incident, Shism is it. The only Imperial who stayed loyal to the clan through and through; occasionally roused suspicion but ended up being a double agent. Changed mind about leaving to serve Plaguebringer and is now the only ex-exaltee the clan trusts.</p>
        <p>Not particularly close with any individuals, but frequently communicated with Maelstrom and Lapilli in the midst of crisis. Doesn't trust Cumulonimbus.</p>
