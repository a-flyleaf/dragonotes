TBA. /sornieth covers the actual setting & its mythos; /dragons discusses the breeds and their "standard" characteristics.

For now, have some stuff that doesn't have its own page yet.

## the world of Sornieth

Alphabetical because what is organization.

- <span id="beastclans">**“Beastclans”**</span> is catch-all term for Sornieth's non-draconic societies. Individual groups are sometimes referred to in the singular, “a beastclan,” if the speaker is unfamiliar with the group's actual name (or doesn't care about it).

- <span id="elements">**Elements**</span> are subcategories of magic (see below) with, as the name suggests, *elemental* affiliations. Dragons seem to be the only species on Sornieth with eye colors that correlate to their element, and while there are scattered folktales about non-elemental dragons, this is physically impossible. If a dragon egg doesn't absorb enough elemental energy during [incubation](#reproduction), it will die.

- <span id="magic">**Magic**</span> is a thing here, and is to life on Sornieth as carbon is to life on earth. No one knows exactly how it works, but it's a thing! It also has eleven elemental leanings for no apparent reason. It's *magic.* No one can explain how it works. That's why it's *magic.*

- <span id="sornieth">**Sornieth**</span> is the supercontinent on which all dragons live. It is a topographic nightmare, but a ~magical~ topographic nightmare. The population is growing exponentially and it does not ever seem to be running out of space. This is fine! It's fine.

## dragons

- Dragons are <span id="age">**effectively immortal**</span>. One has never been recorded succumbing to age or starvation. Disease? They're more prone to mutation than being killed outright. Depending on the individual, existential horror may or may not be a concern.
	- As a result of the above, the concept of **<span id="exaltation">exaltation</span>** is known to nearly all clans—though the connotations of the term vary significantly. The prevailing view, as suggested by the name, is that exaltation is the highest honor a dragon can receive: they are sent on a noble quest to join their chosen deity for the rest of eternity. Viewed more cynically, exaltation is a ritual (self-)sacrifice. The truth remains unclear, as few exalted dragons ever return—and those who supposedly *do* have immense difficulty validating their stories.

- Although dragons have a "male/female" <span id="sex">sex</span> distinction typical of earth's complex organisms, all it really determines is whether two dragons can [reproduce](#reproduction) or not. Ask five different dragons what they think of gender and you'll get five different answers.

- Dragon <span id="breeds">**breeds**</span> are defined here as distinct morphologies; they're more like dog breeds in that, despite some mass physical disparities (ex. a great dane and chihuahua, or imperial and fae), they can all interbreed. (Ancients are an exception to this. Something something they spilt from the evolutionary bloodline too early.) Oddly, whereas a dog breed mix might yield a mutt of indeterminate lineage, dragons tend to look mostly like *one* particular breed, and *may or may not* have traits resembling the other breeds in their bloodline.
	- <span id="progens">There are still pockets</span> of "common" breeds (mirrors, faes, tundras, and guardians) living throughout Sornieth. This is the "default" origin of any **progenitor** or **"first generation"** dragon; these dragons look closest to the "breed standard," and if they change breeds, they're least likely to maintain traits of their previous morphology.

- <span id="reproduction">**Reproduction**</span> happens when two dragons love each other very much (ideally) and suddenly eggs happen. We don't know how they got there, but they had them. Eggs gain their elemental affiliation from the nest, not the parent(s), and will *not* form correctly without proper incubation. (Egg rot isn't a mechanic anymore but it's fun to think about lore-wise.) <a href="#elements">As noted below,</a> a dragon egg without an element is an egg that never hatches.
	- Nocturne, bogsneak, and banescale eggs don't *appear* to have elemental affiliations no. They're outliers adn should not have been counted. But the hatchlings have elements no matter what.
	
- All (modern) dragons are raised on a <span id="language">single verbal language</span> known colloquially **common draconian**. This tends to get translated seamlessly into English because this is written by an English-speaking person on a canonically-English website in a dominantly-English society.

- The concept of the clan is *extremely* important to all dragons. Many draconic societies
