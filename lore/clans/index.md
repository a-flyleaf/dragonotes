## dragons without lore

### Avi & Iko

This duo, known also as “my two types of brain cells,” are dragons who basically exist to represent me, Archaeoraptor, the person behind the ~~curtain~~ entire webpage you’re looking at.

- <span id="avi"><b>Avi T. Raptor</b></span> (“avatar” + “raptor”) is a self-proclaimed <i>dracologist</i>, which is like anthropology but for dragons. Although not usually a talkative dragon, Avi enjoys rambling about her documentation, which centers on [a select few clans](/lore/clans/by-clan) and related travelers.

	Some find Avi’s “outsider looking in” attitude perturbing; one dragon’s meta-awareness is another’s sign of madness. Avi thinks this is laughable, because narrators don’t care what lore dragons think is impossible.

- <b>Iko N. Aeon</b> (“icon” + “neon”) is here to have a good time. Expressive and upbeat, he enjoys eavesdropping and occasionally throws in his own two cents. Sometimes twenty cents. Wingin’ it all the way down.
	
	If Avi is the studious scholar, Iko is the curious explorer. He has no notion of “meta-awareness”—or if he does, he doesn’t overthink it. Iko doesn’t care. He “is just a little man.”

### fodder retirement

These three are fodder breeders—or at least were, on and off (mostly off). Then everything changed when the eye types attacked, as did breeding projects. Still, sentimentality will be the end of me; good run, fellas.

- <b>“mintdad” Rothide</b> was the first dragon I bought with the express purpose of breeding fodder. He went through two mates (the first of which was sold on request; both are now exalted), and some of his offspring were fodder breeders too.
	
	He also didn’t have a name until after “retirement,” and even then, Rothide (literally “rot” + hide, and a play on “Roth”) is a surname. My vague little lore idea is that he’s a necromancer, and his “offspring” are dragons he’s raised. Legend has it he’s still at it, just not with his own kids.
	
- <b>Azrael and Zara</b> are the last surviving fodder pair; Avi once described them as (to paraphrase from memory) the “weird but harmless goths sitting in the back of the lair.” Their kids are named after Greco-Roman deities because apparently they were trying to raise gods.
	
	Fun facts: Both of their bios were once used for onsite wishlists; festival skins on Zara, everything else on Azrael. Zara is Rothide’s daughter and wears a bow in her father’s honor; Azrael has followed suit but for his mate. Rothide just wants them to stop telling dragons he’s dead.
