Because I have so much lore. *So much.* It must be moved here.

...Eventually. Have some FAQs that haven't actually been asked.

## What is this?

If you somehow stumbled upon this page without context: This is a "wiki" (self-made and -maintained) for all my creative writing about [Flight Rising](https://www1.flightrising.com/)! Lots of players enjoy fleshing out their dragons' characters & the world in which they live, and I am no exception.

## Why make a wiki?

> **TL;DR:** Lore, by design, is never "finished." I think a wiki-like format fits it nicely!

Longer answer: The concept of "lore" fascinates me. On one hand, writing is often something of a linear process: traditionally, you brainstorm, outline, actually write, revise, rinse and repeat as needed. It's all in service to **a finished product**, whether it's a novel or a game script.

But writing about dragons on a petsite is different. Depending how far you take it, it's part character development, part worldbuilding, part plot--and even if you've written bios for all your dragons, there's no telling when a brand new idea or game development will catch you by surprise. Unless you come up with a solid idea and stick to it, **you're never really "done"!** It is, essentially, endless brainstorming, and sometimes things get written down along the way.

And *I love that.* To me, this means there's **no pressure**--there's never going to be a "finished" stage with a finalized product, and there's no audience whose reactions you have to consider. It's just you and the typing box: **ultimate creative freedom**. That, to me, is the best part of writing.

&nbsp;

Of course, the problem with *that* is organization. Where do you even put everything you've written? You'll need to reference it yourself sooner or later, never mind showing other people. The typical answer to this, from what I see, is dragon bios or forum posts. But, uh, if I liked the constraints of dragon bios and forum posts, this entire website would not exist.

Fortunately, I like coding. And I *really* like wiki binges, learning all about a piece of media without touching the source material. There's something about the wiki format that makes you recognize that it is **inherently unfinished**; there's always more information to contribute, more pages to be made. It's not a finalized encyclopedia, it's an ever-edited book.

So here we are!

## But [something about inconsistencies with the canon lore]!

There are two possible reasons for this:

1. I never noticed the original, and/or
1. it's intentional.

Canon is a sandbox and I have x99 Sand in my figurative vault. Maybe more. *My city now.*

## Can I use this for my own lore?

For the **worldbuilding**, sure! I'm just expanding on and messing with what FR already offers.

I would prefer if you didn't copy my **dragons**' characters wholesale, but I can't stop you. Consider putting your own twist on them, though!

## Are you open to roleplaying and/or lore collabs?

No, sorry; I don't have the time, and if I *am* going to write with another person, I'd rather do it with someone I already know.

Having said that, you are totally free to think of my dragons as NPCs; if you want to write about an encounter between our clans/dragons, then by all means go for it! It doesn't mean I'll incorporate it into my *own* lore, but this is all public for a reason. Have fun~
