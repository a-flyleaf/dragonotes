	also dredge up
	- v1/lore/profile: 2020-01-07
	- about/flowchart
	- /biomaker/ (or it can just Sit There if we're still working on it)
	- +extra stuff in the site/fr folder

	^all these (and more on other minisites) can go on some revamped shriblets linkhub tbh. there are So Many and they are So Scattered

# 2024+ condensed
- trawl gdocs for stuff I can save here onsite instead
- fandragon bio generator

# 2025-02-04
- _data/dragons.yml
	- re-include familiars (optional)/vistas/scenes
	- extra dates?
- _layouts/dragons.html
	- integrate art from data; include ids via forloop (a1,a2,a3) for individual styling
		- use an "if contains" NOT an =, since some arts have multiple dragons
	- auto-populate familiars/scenes/vistas [see above]
	- concatenate & chronologize all dates [also above]

- general art page; should include commissions, other doodles for other people, random Fr-related sketches... There's A Lot.
	- see gdocs for a couple (extremely dated) "art tracker" spreadsheets

# 2025-06-30
- PErHAPS rather than individual dragon pages, one big page with lil clusters? kinda like the old viral evolution page? way way WAY less intimidating to just combine dudes tbh. could be geocities-esque with custom css even if they all use the same basic HTML template. (so uhh basically the original plan for toyshelf, yes.) much to think about....


[keep this at the bottom:]
**skiptrace note**: used a mostly-no-apparel scry for now (outfit will be a WIP until at least August), replace it when the outfit's done
	(plain scry images, in general, are not suuuper necessary; as long as the data's recorded, the picture can be regenerated on the fly)
